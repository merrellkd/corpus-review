# Project Feature - Consolidated Structure

## Overview

This feature consolidates all project-related functionality following the prescribed feature folder pattern. The component has been moved from the global components directory and DDD patterns have been simplified.

## Structure

```
frontend/src/features/project/
├── components/
│   └── ProjectWorkspace.tsx      # Main workspace component
├── types/
│   ├── project-types.ts          # Simplified project types
│   └── workspace-types.ts        # Simplified workspace types
└── index.ts                      # Clean feature exports
```

## Migration from DDD Patterns

### Before (Complex DDD)
- `domain/aggregates/project.ts` - Complex aggregate root
- `domain/value-objects/` - Multiple value objects
- `infrastructure/` - Repository patterns
- Global `components/ProjectWorkspace.tsx`

### After (Simplified)
- Flat `types/` with simple interfaces
- Direct component imports
- Clean feature exports via `index.ts`
- Backward-compatible re-exports

## Import Paths

### New (Recommended)
```typescript
import { ProjectWorkspace } from '@/features/project';
import type { WorkspaceProps, Project } from '@/features/project';
```

### Legacy (Backward Compatible)
```typescript
import { ProjectWorkspace } from '@/components/ProjectWorkspace';
```

**Note**: Legacy imports show deprecation warnings in development mode.

## Migration Steps for Other Features

1. Update imports to use new feature path
2. Remove dependency on old DDD structures
3. Use simplified types from feature exports
4. Test functionality remains unchanged

## Removed DDD Complexity

- ❌ Domain aggregates and entities
- ❌ Value objects for simple data
- ❌ Repository pattern abstractions
- ❌ Infrastructure layer complexity
- ✅ Simple, flat type interfaces
- ✅ Direct component usage
- ✅ Clear feature boundaries
