# Feature Specification: Unify Store Pattern

**Feature Branch**: `007-unify-store-pattern`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Unify Store pattern in frontend/src such that all stores are locatione in a centralized /stores/ folder"

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a developer working on the Corpus Review application, I need all state management stores to be located in a centralized `/stores/` folder so that I can easily locate, manage, and maintain application state without searching across multiple feature directories and inconsistent locations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** stores are currently scattered across features and domains, **When** I need to find a specific store, **Then** I can locate it in the centralized `frontend/src/stores/` directory
2. **Given** the unified store structure, **When** I need to understand application state architecture, **Then** all stores are co-located with consistent naming and organization patterns
3. **Given** the centralized store pattern, **When** I create a new store, **Then** I follow established conventions and place it in the `/stores/` directory
4. **Given** the refactored store structure, **When** I run the application, **Then** all existing functionality continues to work without regression

### Edge Cases

- What happens to feature-specific stores that contain domain logic? (Should maintain domain separation while centralizing location)
- How are cross-feature store dependencies managed? (Clear import patterns and dependency management)
- What happens to existing imports when stores are moved? (All import paths must be updated consistently)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST consolidate all state management stores into `frontend/src/stores/` directory organized in subdirectories by feature
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain clear separation where single-feature stores remain feature-specific and multi-feature stores become global
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve all existing store functionality during consolidation
- **FR-004**: System MUST update all import references atomically in single commit to use new centralized store locations
- **FR-005**: System MUST establish consistent kebab-case naming with descriptive suffixes (e.g., project-store.ts, workspace-store.ts)
- **FR-006**: System MUST organize stores by functional area (e.g., project-store.ts, workspace-store.ts, ui-store.ts)
- **FR-007**: System MUST eliminate duplicate functionality while keeping stores separate for different concerns
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain TypeScript compilation without errors after consolidation
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve existing store APIs and interfaces to prevent breaking changes
- **FR-010**: System MUST document the unified store architecture and conventions

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27

- Q: How should overlapping functionality be handled? → A: Keep separate stores but eliminate duplicate functionality
- Q: What determines if a store should be feature-specific vs global? → A: Store scope: single feature = feature-specific, multiple features = global
- Q: Should feature-specific stores be moved to centralized `/stores/` folder? → A: Move to `/stores/` but organize in subdirectories by feature
- Q: What naming pattern should be used for centralized stores? → A: kebab-case with descriptive suffixes (i.e., workspace-store.ts)
- Q: How should import path updates be handled during transition? → A: Update all imports atomically in single commit

### Key Entities

- **Project Store**: State management for project CRUD operations, listings, and metadata
- **Workspace Store**: State management for file navigation, directory listings, and workspace context
- **UI Store**: State management for panel layouts, navigation state, and user interface concerns
- **File Categorization Store**: State management for file organization and categorization features
- **Panel State Store**: State management for resizable panels and layout configurations
