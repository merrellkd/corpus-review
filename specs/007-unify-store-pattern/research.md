# Research: Unify Store Pattern

## Current Store Analysis

### Existing Store Locations
Research conducted on current store distribution across the frontend:

**Current Distribution:**
- `/frontend/src/stores/` (6 files): workspaceStore.ts, workspace-store.ts, fileCategorization.ts, panelStateMachine.ts, unifiedPanelState.ts, types/
- `/frontend/src/features/project-management/` (1 file): store.ts
- `/frontend/src/domains/workspace/ui/stores/` (1 file): workspace-store.ts

### Store Functionality Analysis

**Project Management Stores:**
- `/features/project-management/store.ts`: Complete Zustand store for project CRUD operations
- Scope: Single feature (project management)
- Dependencies: Project domain types, Tauri backend integration

**Workspace Stores (Multiple overlapping implementations):**
- `/stores/workspaceStore.ts`: File system navigation, directory listings
- `/stores/workspace-store.ts`: Alternative workspace implementation
- `/domains/workspace/ui/stores/workspace-store.ts`: Domain-specific workspace store
- Scope: Multiple features (workspace navigation, document workspace)
- **Overlap detected**: Multiple workspace stores with similar concerns

**UI State Stores:**
- `/stores/panelStateMachine.ts`: Panel state management
- `/stores/unifiedPanelState.ts`: Unified panel state logic
- `/stores/fileCategorization.ts`: File organization features
- Scope: Cross-feature UI concerns

## Technical Decisions

### Decision: Zustand State Management Strategy
**Rationale**: Current implementation uses Zustand exclusively across all stores
**Alternatives considered**: Redux Toolkit, Context API, Jotai
**Selected**: Continue with Zustand for consistency and existing patterns

### Decision: Feature Subdirectory Organization
**Rationale**: Maintains logical separation while centralizing location
**Alternatives considered**: Flat structure, feature prefixing, separate directories
**Selected**: `/stores/{feature}/` subdirectory structure for clear organization

### Decision: Store Consolidation Approach
**Rationale**: Multiple workspace stores create confusion and potential conflicts
**Alternatives considered**: Keep all stores separate, merge into single workspace store
**Selected**: Eliminate duplicate functionality while keeping stores separate for different concerns

### Decision: Migration Strategy
**Rationale**: Atomic updates prevent inconsistent import states during transition
**Alternatives considered**: Gradual migration, temporary re-exports, automated tooling
**Selected**: Single commit with all import path updates to ensure consistency

## Best Practices Research

### Zustand Organization Patterns
- **Co-location**: Group related state and actions in single store
- **Slicing**: Use store slices for complex state management
- **Selectors**: Implement selectors for computed state
- **Middleware**: Leverage devtools and persistence middleware appropriately

### TypeScript Store Patterns
- **Strict typing**: Ensure all store interfaces are properly typed
- **Export patterns**: Use consistent export strategies for stores and types
- **Import paths**: Establish clear, predictable import path conventions

### Testing Strategies
- **Store isolation**: Test stores independently from components
- **State transitions**: Verify state changes through actions
- **Integration**: Test store integration with components via React Testing Library

## Implementation Constraints

### Preservation Requirements
- All existing store APIs must remain unchanged
- TypeScript compilation must pass throughout migration
- No behavioral changes to existing functionality
- Import path updates must be comprehensive and atomic

### Performance Considerations
- Store access patterns must maintain current performance
- Bundle size impact should be minimal or positive
- Runtime overhead from reorganization should be negligible

### Development Experience
- Clear, intuitive store locations for developers
- Consistent naming conventions across all stores
- Documentation of unified architecture and patterns
