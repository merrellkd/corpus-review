# Quickstart: Frontend Architecture Refactoring

## Validation Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Project Management Feature Functionality
**Objective**: Verify project management features work after refactoring

**Pre-requisites**:
- Application running in development mode
- At least one project exists in the database

**Steps**:
1. Open the Corpus Review application
2. Navigate to the project list page
3. Verify all projects are displayed correctly
4. Click "Create New Project" button
5. Fill out the project creation form with valid data
6. Submit the form
7. Verify the new project appears in the list
8. Select an existing project from the list
9. Click the "Open Project" button
10. Verify project opens successfully
11. Delete a test project using the delete button
12. Verify project is removed from the list

**Expected Results**:
- All project list operations function identically to pre-refactoring
- No console errors related to missing imports or broken components
- UI renders correctly with no visual regressions

### Scenario 2: Workspace Navigation Functionality
**Objective**: Verify workspace navigation features work after refactoring

**Pre-requisites**:
- Application running with project opened
- Project has a valid source folder with files

**Steps**:
1. Open a project to enter workspace view
2. Verify file list displays correctly
3. Navigate into a subdirectory by double-clicking
4. Verify breadcrumb navigation shows current path
5. Use "Up" button to navigate to parent directory
6. Verify file metadata (size, modified date) displays correctly
7. Navigate to different folder levels
8. Verify workspace context persists during navigation
9. Return to project list and open different project
10. Verify workspace state resets appropriately

**Expected Results**:
- File system navigation works identically to pre-refactoring
- All file metadata displays correctly
- Navigation state management functions properly
- No broken imports or missing dependencies

### Scenario 3: Document Workspace Functionality
**Objective**: Verify document viewing and workspace layout work after refactoring

**Pre-requisites**:
- Application running with project opened
- Project contains document files

**Steps**:
1. Select a document file from the file list
2. Verify document opens in the workspace
3. Test workspace layout switching (if applicable)
4. Verify document caddy functionality
5. Test any document editing features
6. Verify panel resizing works correctly
7. Test multiple document handling
8. Verify workspace error handling for invalid files

**Expected Results**:
- Document viewing functions identically to pre-refactoring
- Workspace layout and panel management work correctly
- No UI/UX regressions in document interaction

### Scenario 4: Cross-Feature Integration
**Objective**: Verify features work together after consolidation

**Pre-requisites**:
- Application running with multiple projects and documents

**Steps**:
1. Create a new project from project management
2. Immediately open the created project
3. Navigate through workspace files
4. Open a document in the workspace
5. Return to project list
6. Open a different project
7. Verify workspace state resets properly
8. Test UI layout state persistence across features

**Expected Results**:
- Seamless transitions between features
- No state leakage between features
- Global UI state maintains consistency

## Build and Test Validation

### TypeScript Compilation Check
```bash
cd frontend
npm run typecheck
```
**Expected**: No TypeScript errors

### Unit Test Execution
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:unit
```
**Expected**: All existing unit tests pass

### Integration Test Execution
```bash
cd frontend
npm run test:integration
```
**Expected**: All integration tests pass

### Development Build
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
**Expected**: Application starts without errors

### Production Build
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
**Expected**: Build completes successfully

## Performance Validation

### Load Time Verification
1. Start the application
2. Measure time to initial render
3. Compare with pre-refactoring baseline
4. Verify no significant performance degradation

### Memory Usage Check
1. Open developer tools
2. Monitor memory usage during typical workflows
3. Verify no memory leaks introduced
4. Check for excessive re-renders

## Rollback Procedures

### If Critical Issues Found
1. Stop development server
2. Check git status for uncommitted changes
3. Revert to previous commit: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`
4. Restart development server
5. Re-run validation scenarios
6. Document issues for future resolution

### Incremental Rollback
1. Identify specific feature causing issues
2. Revert only that feature's file movements
3. Update imports for reverted files
4. Re-run TypeScript compilation
5. Test specific functionality

## Success Criteria Checklist

- [ ] All validation scenarios pass completely
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] No visual or functional regressions detected
- [ ] Build process completes successfully
- [ ] Performance metrics remain within acceptable range
- [ ] No console errors during normal operation
- [ ] Feature self-containment verified (no cross-feature imports)
- [ ] Store consolidation eliminates all duplicate state management

## Post-Refactoring Verification

### File Structure Audit
```bash
# Verify feature structure compliance
find frontend/src/features -type d -name "components" | wc -l  # Should equal number of features
find frontend/src/features -type d -name "hooks" | wc -l      # Should equal number of features
find frontend/src/features -type d -name "services" | wc -l   # Should equal number of features
find frontend/src/features -type d -name "types" | wc -l      # Should equal number of features
```

### Import Analysis
```bash
# Check for prohibited cross-feature imports
grep -r "import.*features/" frontend/src/features/ | grep -v "shared" | grep -v "stores"
# Should return no results
```

### Store Duplication Check
```bash
# Verify no duplicate Zustand stores
find frontend/src -name "*store*" -type f | xargs grep -l "create.*store"
# Review output to ensure no overlapping state management
```
