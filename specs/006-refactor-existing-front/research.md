# Research: Frontend Architecture Refactoring

## File Organization Strategy

**Decision**: Implement feature-based vertical slices following constitutional requirements
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional mandate for feature-based architecture with self-contained vertical slices
- Improves developer experience by co-locating related functionality
- Reduces cognitive load when working on specific features
- Eliminates the need to search across multiple directories for related code

**Alternatives considered**:
- Maintain current DDD structure: Rejected - violates constitutional requirements
- Hybrid approach: Rejected - would create inconsistent patterns and confusion

## State Management Consolidation

**Decision**: Consolidate overlapping stores while maintaining separate stores for distinct concerns
**Rationale**:
- Current structure has duplicate workspace state (workspace-store.ts, workspaceStore.ts)
- Constitutional requirement to eliminate duplicate state management
- Maintains clear separation between feature state and global UI state

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single global store: Rejected - violates feature self-containment principle
- Complete elimination of global state: Rejected - some UI state truly spans features

## DDD Structure Flattening

**Decision**: Flatten existing DDD structures into feature-based conventions (services/, types/, components/)
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for feature-based organization over domain-driven patterns in frontend
- Simplifies file structure while preserving business logic organization
- Maintains separation of concerns within feature boundaries

**Alternatives considered**:
- Preserve full DDD structure within features: Rejected - conflicts with constitutional feature organization
- Complete elimination of domain concepts: Rejected - would lose valuable business logic organization

## Test Organization Strategy

**Decision**: Move unit tests into feature directories, keep integration tests centralized
**Rationale**:
- Unit tests are closely tied to specific feature implementations
- Integration tests verify cross-feature interactions, better centralized
- Maintains ability to run feature-specific test suites
- Preserves existing integration test infrastructure

**Alternatives considered**:
- All tests in features: Rejected - would duplicate integration test setup
- All tests centralized: Rejected - reduces feature self-containment

## Component Reusability Criteria

**Decision**: Components qualify as shared if used by 3+ features AND contain no feature-specific business logic
**Rationale**:
- Clear, measurable criteria prevents subjective decisions
- Ensures truly reusable components aren't embedded in features
- Prevents premature abstraction of components used by only 1-2 features

**Alternatives considered**:
- Any component used by 2+ features: Rejected - too aggressive, leads to premature abstraction
- Only UI primitives: Rejected - too restrictive, useful business-agnostic components would remain duplicated

## Migration Validation Approach

**Decision**: Manual testing of key workflows after completing each feature directory
**Rationale**:
- Incremental validation reduces risk of breaking changes
- Manual testing ensures UI/UX remains intact during structural changes
- Allows early detection of import or dependency issues

**Alternatives considered**:
- Complete refactoring then test: Rejected - high risk of accumulating breaking changes
- Automated testing only: Rejected - may miss subtle UI/UX regressions during file moves

## Implementation Order

**Decision**:
1. Create new feature directory structure
2. Move project-management feature (smallest, well-contained)
3. Move document-workspace feature
4. Move workspace-navigation feature (largest, most complex)
5. Consolidate shared components and global stores
6. Update all import statements
7. Migrate unit tests into features

**Rationale**: Start with least complex feature to validate approach, end with most complex to benefit from lessons learned

## Risk Mitigation

**Key Risks Identified**:
- Import statement breakage during file moves
- State management coupling between features
- Test infrastructure compatibility with new structure

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- TypeScript compiler will catch import errors immediately
- Incremental testing after each feature migration
- Preserve existing test runner configuration, only move test files
