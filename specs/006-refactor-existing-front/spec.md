# Feature Specification: Frontend Architecture Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `006-refactor-existing-front`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Implemented (Partial)
**Input**: User description: "refactor existing front-end folder structure to match that found in the constitution."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Corpus Review application, I need the frontend codebase to follow the constitutional feature-based architecture so that I can locate functionality intuitively, maintain clear separation of concerns, and ensure each feature is self-contained with minimal external dependencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current mixed DDD/component-based structure, **When** the refactoring is complete, **Then** all features exist as complete vertical slices under `frontend/src/features/{feature-name}/`
2. **Given** scattered components and stores across multiple directories, **When** examining any feature directory, **Then** it contains all related components, hooks, services, and types in its own subdirectories
3. **Given** the refactored structure, **When** a developer needs to modify project management functionality, **Then** all related code is contained within the `features/project-management/` directory
4. **Given** the new structure, **When** running the application, **Then** all existing functionality continues to work without regression

### Edge Cases
- What happens when shared utilities are needed across features? (Must be moved to `shared/` only if used by 3+ features AND contain no feature-specific business logic)
- How does the workspace domain's complex DDD structure integrate with feature-based organization? (DDD structure flattened into services/, types/, components/ within workspace-navigation feature)
- What happens to existing stores that span multiple features? (Consolidate overlapping stores while maintaining separate stores for distinct concerns per constitutional requirements)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Implemented âœ…
- **FR-002**: System MUST move all project-related components, hooks, services, and types into `features/project-management/` âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **FR-004**: System MUST create `features/document-workspace/` containing document-related UI components âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve existing functionality while restructuring - no behavior changes allowed âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **FR-010**: System MUST update all import statements to reflect new structure âœ… **COMPLETED** (for implemented features)
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain TypeScript compilation without errors âœ… **COMPLETED**
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate functionality through manual testing of key workflows âœ… **COMPLETED**

#### Deferred for Future Implementation ðŸ”„
- **FR-001**: System MUST reorganize ALL frontend code into feature-based vertical slices - **PARTIALLY COMPLETED** (project-management and document-workspace features only)
- **FR-003**: System MUST consolidate workspace functionality into `features/workspace-navigation/` - **DEFERRED** (due to complexity)
- **FR-006**: System MUST consolidate overlapping stores - **DEFERRED**
- **FR-007**: System MUST move components to `shared/components/` - **DEFERRED**
- **FR-008**: System MUST consolidate global application state - **DEFERRED**
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure each feature is self-contained - **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve all existing tests - **PARTIALLY COMPLETED**
- **FR-014**: System MUST flatten existing DDD structures - **DEFERRED**

## Implementation Summary

### Successfully Completed (Phase 3.1 - 3.4)

#### Feature Structure Established âœ…
- Created constitutional feature-based directory structure under `frontend/src/features/`
- Established validation tests to ensure feature compliance
- All test cases passing for completed features

#### Project Management Feature âœ…
**Location**: `frontend/src/features/project-management/`
- **Components**: ProjectListPage, project-row, create-project-form
- **Store**: Complete Zustand store with project CRUD operations
- **Types**: All project domain types and interfaces
- **Services**: Project API services and repository patterns
- **Tests**: Unit tests moved to feature directory
- **Status**: Fully functional with TypeScript compilation passing

#### Document Workspace Feature âœ…
**Location**: `frontend/src/features/document-workspace/`
- **Components**: DocumentWorkspace, FileExplorer, FilesCategoriesPanel, SearchPanel
- **Integration**: Properly connected to global workspace stores
- **Imports**: All external references updated to new paths
- **Status**: Fully functional with clean TypeScript compilation

#### Constitutional Compliance âœ…
- Feature self-containment validated
- Import path structure follows constitutional guidelines
- TypeScript strict mode compilation maintained
- No behavioral regressions introduced
- Validation tests confirm architectural compliance

### Deferred for Future Implementation

#### Workspace Navigation Feature (Phase 3.5)
**Reason**: Complex interdependencies between 50+ files created TypeScript compilation complexity beyond current scope
**Recommendation**: Implement incrementally in smaller batches with per-file validation

#### Shared Component Analysis (Phase 3.6+)
**Reason**: Core feature structure successfully established; shared components can be addressed in subsequent iterations
**Status**: Foundation laid for future expansion

### Architecture Impact

#### Before Refactoring
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/           # Mixed concerns
â”œâ”€â”€ domains/project/      # DDD structure
â”œâ”€â”€ ui/pages/            # Scattered pages
â”œâ”€â”€ stores/              # Global state
```

#### After Refactoring (Implemented)
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ features/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ project-management/     # âœ… Complete vertical slice
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ store.ts
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ tests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ document-workspace/     # âœ… UI components slice
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ domains/              # Remaining complex domains
â”œâ”€â”€ stores/               # Global state (consolidated)
â””â”€â”€ shared/               # Cross-cutting concerns
```

### Key Entities
- **Feature Directories**: Self-contained vertical slices containing components, hooks, services, types, and store files
- **Project Management Feature**: All project CRUD, listing, and management functionality
- **Workspace Navigation Feature**: File system navigation, directory listing, and workspace context
- **Document Workspace Feature**: Document viewing, editing, and workspace layout functionality
- **Shared Resources**: Truly reusable components, hooks, services, types, and utilities used across multiple features
- **Global Stores**: UI layout state and cross-feature application state only

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What validation approach should be used to ensure no regressions occur? â†’ A: Manual testing of key workflows after each feature directory is completed
- Q: How should the workspace domain's internal DDD structure be preserved within the new feature-based organization? â†’ A: Flatten the DDD structure into services/, types/, and components/ following feature-based conventions
- Q: What consolidation strategy should be used for eliminating duplicate state management? â†’ A: Consolidate overlapping stores but maintain separate stores for distinct concerns
- Q: What criteria should determine if a component qualifies as truly reusable versus feature-specific? â†’ A: Used by 3+ features AND has no feature-specific business logic
- Q: What should happen to existing test files organized by type rather than by feature? â†’ A: Keep integration tests centralized but move unit tests into respective feature directories
