# Feature Specification: Frontend Architecture Refactoring

**Feature Branch**: `006-refactor-existing-front`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "refactor existing front-end folder structure to match that found in the constitution."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the Corpus Review application, I need the frontend codebase to follow the constitutional feature-based architecture so that I can locate functionality intuitively, maintain clear separation of concerns, and ensure each feature is self-contained with minimal external dependencies.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the current mixed DDD/component-based structure, **When** the refactoring is complete, **Then** all features exist as complete vertical slices under `frontend/src/features/{feature-name}/`
2. **Given** scattered components and stores across multiple directories, **When** examining any feature directory, **Then** it contains all related components, hooks, services, and types in its own subdirectories
3. **Given** the refactored structure, **When** a developer needs to modify project management functionality, **Then** all related code is contained within the `features/project-management/` directory
4. **Given** the new structure, **When** running the application, **Then** all existing functionality continues to work without regression

### Edge Cases
- What happens when shared utilities are needed across features? (Must be moved to `shared/` only if used by 3+ features AND contain no feature-specific business logic)
- How does the workspace domain's complex DDD structure integrate with feature-based organization? (DDD structure flattened into services/, types/, components/ within workspace-navigation feature)
- What happens to existing stores that span multiple features? (Consolidate overlapping stores while maintaining separate stores for distinct concerns per constitutional requirements)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST reorganize all frontend code into feature-based vertical slices under `frontend/src/features/{feature-name}/`
- **FR-002**: System MUST move all project-related components, hooks, services, and types into `features/project-management/`
- **FR-003**: System MUST consolidate workspace functionality into `features/workspace-navigation/` with complete vertical slice organization
- **FR-004**: System MUST create `features/document-workspace/` containing all document-related UI and business logic
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve existing functionality while restructuring - no behavior changes allowed
- **FR-006**: System MUST consolidate overlapping stores while maintaining separate stores for distinct concerns per constitutional requirements
- **FR-007**: System MUST move components to `shared/components/` only if used by 3+ features AND contain no feature-specific business logic
- **FR-008**: System MUST consolidate global application state into `stores/` limited to UI layout state and app-level concerns
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure each feature is self-contained with minimal external dependencies
- **FR-010**: System MUST update all import statements to reflect new structure
- **FR-011**: System MUST preserve all existing tests, moving unit tests into respective feature directories while keeping integration tests centralized
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain TypeScript compilation without errors
- **FR-013**: System MUST validate functionality through manual testing of key workflows after completing each feature directory refactoring
- **FR-014**: System MUST flatten existing DDD structures (domain/, application/, infrastructure/) into feature-based conventions (services/, types/, components/)

### Key Entities
- **Feature Directories**: Self-contained vertical slices containing components, hooks, services, types, and store files
- **Project Management Feature**: All project CRUD, listing, and management functionality
- **Workspace Navigation Feature**: File system navigation, directory listing, and workspace context
- **Document Workspace Feature**: Document viewing, editing, and workspace layout functionality
- **Shared Resources**: Truly reusable components, hooks, services, types, and utilities used across multiple features
- **Global Stores**: UI layout state and cross-feature application state only

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: What validation approach should be used to ensure no regressions occur? → A: Manual testing of key workflows after each feature directory is completed
- Q: How should the workspace domain's internal DDD structure be preserved within the new feature-based organization? → A: Flatten the DDD structure into services/, types/, and components/ following feature-based conventions
- Q: What consolidation strategy should be used for eliminating duplicate state management? → A: Consolidate overlapping stores but maintain separate stores for distinct concerns
- Q: What criteria should determine if a component qualifies as truly reusable versus feature-specific? → A: Used by 3+ features AND has no feature-specific business logic
- Q: What should happen to existing test files organized by type rather than by feature? → A: Keep integration tests centralized but move unit tests into respective feature directories
