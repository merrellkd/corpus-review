# Research: Project Workspace Component Consolidation

## Component Relocation Patterns

**Decision**: Move ProjectWorkspace.tsx to feature folder structure
**Rationale**: Aligns with constitutional principle III requiring feature-based organization
**Alternatives considered**: Keep in global components (rejected - violates constitution)

## DDD Pattern Simplification

**Decision**: Remove domain/infrastructure layers entirely, flatten to simple types
**Rationale**: Constitutional prohibition of over-engineered domain abstractions in UI layer
**Alternatives considered**: Partial simplification (rejected - user specified complete removal)

## Backward Compatibility Strategy

**Decision**: Temporary re-export from old location with gradual deprecation
**Rationale**: Minimizes immediate breaking changes while enabling transition
**Alternatives considered**: Immediate breaking change (rejected - too disruptive), permanent re-export (rejected - doesn't achieve consolidation goal)

## Folder Structure Pattern

**Decision**: Flat structure with components/, types/, index.ts
**Rationale**: Specified in clarifications, aligns with constitutional simplicity requirements
**Alternatives considered**: Nested subfolder organization (rejected - specified as flat structure)

## Import Management Strategy

**Decision**: Update imports gradually, maintain compatibility during transition
**Rationale**: Allows incremental adoption of new import paths
**Alternatives considered**: Mass import update (rejected - higher risk of breakage)

## Research Complete
All technical decisions resolved through specification clarifications. No additional unknowns requiring research.
