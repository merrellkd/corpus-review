# Feature Specification: Project Workspace Component Consolidation

**Feature Branch**: `008-consolidate-frontend-src`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Consolidate frontend/src/components/ProjectWorkspace.tsx with frontend/src/features/project and bring it all together into our prescribed feature folder pattern, refactoring out the ddd patterns that currently exist. This will entail significant simplification of the code files."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Consolidate ProjectWorkspace.tsx into project feature folder
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers; Actions: simplify/consolidate; Data: React components; Constraints: feature folder pattern
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Code organization approach is clear
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow for component usage
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí ProjectWorkspace component, simplified file structure
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Implementation-focused but architectural consolidation
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: When simplifying the current DDD patterns, what level of simplification should be applied? ‚Üí A: Remove domain/infrastructure layers entirely, flatten to simple types and components
- Q: What specific folder structure should be used within the project feature folder? ‚Üí A: Flat structure: components/, types/, index.ts (no subfolders)
- Q: How should backward compatibility be handled for existing imports of the ProjectWorkspace component? ‚Üí A: Create temporary re-export from old location, deprecate gradually

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the codebase, I need the ProjectWorkspace component to be organized within the prescribed feature folder pattern alongside related project functionality, so that I can maintain a clear, consistent code organization without complex DDD layers that are unnecessarily verbose for the current codebase size.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer needs to modify project workspace functionality, **When** they navigate to the project feature folder, **Then** they should find the ProjectWorkspace component co-located with related project code
2. **Given** a developer is adding new project-related features, **When** they examine the project feature structure, **Then** they should see a simplified organization without excessive DDD abstraction layers
3. **Given** a developer imports project workspace functionality, **When** they use the import statements, **Then** they should import from the feature folder structure rather than a separate components directory

### Edge Cases
- What happens when existing components depend on the current ProjectWorkspace location? ‚Üí Handled via temporary re-export for gradual deprecation
- How does system handle imports that need to be updated after consolidation? ‚Üí Old imports continue working through re-export, new imports use feature folder path

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST relocate ProjectWorkspace.tsx into the project feature folder structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain all existing ProjectWorkspace component functionality and behavior
- **FR-003**: System MUST create temporary re-export from old location and deprecate gradually for backward compatibility
- **FR-004**: System MUST remove domain/infrastructure layers entirely and flatten to simple types and components
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve component props interface and external API compatibility
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain test compatibility and coverage for the relocated component
- **FR-007**: System MUST organize project-related functionality using flat structure with components/, types/, and index.ts

### Key Entities
- **ProjectWorkspace Component**: React component managing project workspace UI layout and interaction
- **Project Feature Folder**: Consolidated location containing all project-related frontend code
- **Import Dependencies**: References from other components that need updating after relocation
