# Quickstart: Project Workspace

**Feature**: Project Workspace
**Date**: 2025-09-19
**Purpose**: Validate implementation against user scenarios

## Prerequisites
- Project created with Source and Reports folder paths configured
- Tauri application running with filesystem permissions
- React frontend connected to Tauri backend

## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Initial Workspace Load
**Given**: User opens a project with configured Source/Reports folders
**When**: Project Workspace interface loads
**Then**:
- [ ] File Explorer panel shows files from Source folder
- [ ] File Explorer panel shows files from Reports folder
- [ ] Category Explorer panel is visible but empty
- [ ] Search panel is visible but non-functional
- [ ] Multi-Document Workspace area is visible and empty
- [ ] All panel toggle buttons are available in toolbar

**Validation Steps**:
1. Open project "Test Project"
2. Navigate to Project Workspace
3. Verify File Explorer shows test files from both folders
4. Verify Category Explorer displays empty state message
5. Verify Search panel displays placeholder interface
6. Verify MDW area shows "No documents open" state

### Scenario 2: Panel Visibility Controls
**Given**: Workspace is loaded with all panels visible
**When**: User toggles panel visibility
**Then**:
- [ ] File Explorer toggle hides/shows File Explorer independently
- [ ] Category Explorer toggle hides/shows Category Explorer independently
- [ ] Search toggle hides/shows Search panel independently
- [ ] MDW expands to full width when all explorer panels hidden
- [ ] Panel states persist when workspace reloaded

**Validation Steps**:
1. Click File Explorer toggle - verify panel hides, layout adjusts
2. Click Category Explorer toggle - verify panel hides, layout adjusts
3. Click Search toggle - verify panel hides, layout adjusts
4. Verify MDW now spans full width
5. Reload workspace - verify panel states restored
6. Toggle panels back on - verify layout returns to multi-panel mode

### Scenario 3: Panel Resizing
**Given**: Multiple panels are visible
**When**: User drags panel borders
**Then**:
- [ ] Panels resize smoothly in real-time
- [ ] Minimum panel widths enforced (100px explorers, 200px MDW)
- [ ] Layout proportions maintained during resize
- [ ] Panel sizes persist when workspace reloaded
- [ ] Window resize maintains panel proportions

**Validation Steps**:
1. Drag border between File Explorer and MDW - verify smooth resize
2. Attempt to resize below minimum - verify constraint enforcement
3. Resize window - verify proportions maintained
4. Reload workspace - verify panel sizes restored
5. Test resize with different panel combinations visible

### Scenario 4: File System Integration
**Given**: Project folders contain test files
**When**: User interacts with File Explorer
**Then**:
- [ ] Files from Source folder displayed with correct metadata
- [ ] Files from Reports folder displayed with correct metadata
- [ ] Empty folders show appropriate message
- [ ] Inaccessible folders show error message
- [ ] File list updates when folder contents change

**Validation Steps**:
1. Verify test files appear in File Explorer with names, sizes, dates
2. Test with empty Source folder - verify "No files" message
3. Test with inaccessible folder - verify error message
4. Add file to Source folder externally - verify File Explorer updates
5. Remove file from Reports folder - verify File Explorer updates

### Scenario 5: Document Caddy Management
**Given**: Files are available in File Explorer
**When**: User opens multiple documents
**Then**:
- [ ] Each document opens in separate Document Caddy
- [ ] Document Caddies are resizable within MDW area
- [ ] Only one Document Caddy active at a time
- [ ] Document Caddy positions and sizes persist
- [ ] Multiple documents can be open simultaneously

**Validation Steps**:
1. Double-click file in File Explorer - verify Document Caddy created
2. Open second file - verify second Document Caddy created
3. Resize first caddy - verify smooth resize operation
4. Click between caddies - verify active state changes
5. Reload workspace - verify open documents and sizes restored

### Scenario 6: Error Handling
**Given**: Various error conditions exist
**When**: Workspace encounters errors
**Then**:
- [ ] Inaccessible Source folder shows clear error message
- [ ] Inaccessible Reports folder shows clear error message
- [ ] Layout persistence failures gracefully handled
- [ ] Invalid project configuration shows helpful error
- [ ] Network/filesystem errors don't crash interface

**Validation Steps**:
1. Configure project with invalid Source folder path
2. Remove access permissions to Reports folder
3. Verify clear error messages displayed in File Explorer
4. Attempt operations with broken filesystem access
5. Verify interface remains stable and responsive

## Success Criteria
- All scenarios pass validation steps
- No console errors during normal operation
- Smooth 60fps interactions during panel resize
- Panel state persistence works reliably
- Error states provide clear user feedback
- Layout remains responsive across window sizes

## Performance Benchmarks
- Workspace load time: < 1 second for projects with 100+ files
- Panel resize response: < 100ms visual feedback
- File Explorer refresh: < 500ms for folder with 50+ files
- Layout persistence: < 100ms save/restore operations
- Memory usage: < 100MB additional RAM for workspace interface

## Implementation Validation
Run this quickstart after implementation to verify all functional requirements met and user scenarios work as designed.
