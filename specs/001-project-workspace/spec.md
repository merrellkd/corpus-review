# Feature Specification: Project Workspace

**Feature Branch**: `001-project-workspace`
**Created**: 2025-09-19
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Project Workspace"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need a flexible workspace layout to browse project files from Source and Reports folders, with future support for categorization and search. The workspace provides resizable panels that can be independently shown/hidden via toolbar toggles, with a multi-document area for viewing files.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user has a project with Source and Reports folders, **When** they open Project Workspace, **Then** File Explorer shows files from both folders
2. **Given** user clicks File Explorer toggle in toolbar, **When** toggle is activated/deactivated, **Then** File Explorer panel shows/hides independently
3. **Given** user clicks Category Explorer toggle in toolbar, **When** toggle is activated/deactivated, **Then** Category Explorer panel shows/hides independently (currently empty)
4. **Given** user clicks Search toggle in toolbar, **When** toggle is activated/deactivated, **Then** Search panel shows/hides independently
5. **Given** user has multiple panels visible, **When** they drag panel borders, **Then** panels resize while maintaining layout proportions
6. **Given** user opens multiple documents, **When** documents load, **Then** each appears in separate Document Caddy in the Multi-Document Workspace

### Edge Cases
- When all explorer panels are hidden, Multi-Document Workspace expands to full screen width
- How does layout behave when window is resized to minimum dimensions?
- When Source or Reports folders are empty or inaccessible, File Explorer displays appropriate message
- How are panel size preferences persisted between sessions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a workspace interface with resizable panels for file browsing and document viewing
- **FR-002**: System MUST display files from project's Source and Reports folders in File Explorer panel
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide independent toggle controls for File Explorer, Category Explorer, and Search panels
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to resize panels by dragging panel borders
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide Multi-Document Workspace area with Document Caddy containers for multiple open files
- **FR-006**: System MUST show Category Explorer panel layout (empty until future category creation feature)
- **FR-007**: System MUST show Search panel layout (non-functional until future search implementation)
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist panel visibility and size preferences between sessions
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide menu access to Project Info, Utils, and Settings as modal windows
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain responsive layout behavior during window resizing
- **FR-011**: System MUST expand Multi-Document Workspace to full width when all explorer panels are hidden
- **FR-012**: System MUST display informative messages in File Explorer when Source or Reports folders are empty or inaccessible

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: Contains Source folder path and Reports folder path for file browsing
- **WorkspaceLayout**: Panel visibility states, panel dimensions, and layout preferences
- **DocumentCaddy**: Container for individual open documents in the workspace
- **FileExplorerItem**: Represents files from Source and Reports folders with display metadata
