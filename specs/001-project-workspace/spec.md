## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users need a flexible workspace layout with two mutually exclusive panels: a "Files & Categories" panel containing File Explorer and Category Explorer sections that can be independently shown/hidden, and a standalone "Search" panel. Only one of these panels can be visible at a time, controlled by top toolbar toggles. When both File Explorer and Category Explorer sections are visible within the Files & Categories panel, users can drag files onto categories for assignment. When both sections are hidden, the entire Files & Categories panel disappears.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user has a project with Source and Reports folders, **When** they open Project Workspace, **Then** File Explorer section shows files from both folders within the Explorer Panel
2. **Given** user clicks "Files & Categories" toggle in top toolbar, **When** toggle is activated/deactivated, **Then** entire Explorer Panel shows/hides independently
3. **Given** Explorer Panel is visible, **When** user toggles File Explorer section within the panel, **Then** File Explorer section shows/hides while Category Explorer section remains unaffected
4. **Given** Explorer Panel is visible, **When** user toggles Category Explorer section within the panel, **Then** Category Explorer section shows/hides while File Explorer section remains unaffected
5. **Given** both File Explorer and Category Explorer sections are hidden, **When** sections are closed, **Then** entire Explorer Panel disappears from workspace
6. **Given** user clicks "Search" toggle in top toolbar, **When** toggle is activated/deactivated, **Then** Search Panel shows/hides independently of Explorer Panel
7. **Given** user has panels visible, **When** they drag panel borders, **Then** panels resize while maintaining layout proportions
8. **Given** user opens multiple documents, **When** documents load, **Then** each appears in separate Document Caddy in the Multi-Document Workspace

### Edge Cases
- When both Explorer Panel and Search Panel are hidden, Multi-Document Workspace expands to full screen width
- When Explorer Panel is visible but both File Explorer and Category Explorer sections are hidden, Explorer Panel disappears automatically
- How does layout behave when window is resized to minimum dimensions?
- When Source or Reports folders are empty or inaccessible, File Explorer section displays appropriate message
- How are panel size preferences and section visibility states persisted between sessions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a workspace interface with two independent resizable panels: Explorer Panel and Search Panel, plus Multi-Document Workspace
- **FR-002**: System MUST display files from project's Source and Reports folders in File Explorer section within Explorer Panel
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide top toolbar toggles for "Files & Categories" (Explorer Panel) and "Search" (Search Panel) visibility
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to resize panels by dragging panel borders between Explorer Panel, Search Panel, and Multi-Document Workspace
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide Multi-Document Workspace area with Document Caddy containers for multiple open files
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide File Explorer and Category Explorer as separate sections within the Explorer Panel that can be independently shown/hidden
- **FR-007**: System MUST show Category Explorer section layout (empty until future category creation feature)
- **FR-008**: System MUST show Search Panel layout (non-functional until future search implementation)
- **FR-009**: System MUST automatically hide Explorer Panel when both File Explorer and Category Explorer sections are hidden
- **FR-010**: System MUST persist panel visibility, size preferences, and section visibility states between sessions
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide menu access to Project Info, Utils, and Settings as modal windows
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain responsive layout behavior during window resizing
- **FR-013**: System MUST expand Multi-Document Workspace to full width when both Explorer Panel and Search Panel are hidden
- **FR-014**: System MUST display informative messages in File Explorer section when Source or Reports folders are empty or inaccessible
- **FR-015**: System MUST use two-column horizontal layout with either Files & Categories Panel OR Search Panel on left, and Multi-Document Workspace on right
- **FR-016**: System MUST display File Explorer section with hierarchical tree view showing Source and Reports folder structure

### UI Layout Specifications *(from design requirements)*

#### Panel Structure
- **Explorer Panel**: Left-positioned panel containing File Explorer and Category Explorer sections
  - File Explorer section displays hierarchical tree view with Source and Reports folders
  - Category Explorer section shows categorization interface (placeholder until implementation)
  - Both sections can be independently toggled within the panel
  - Panel automatically hides when both sections are closed

- **Search Panel**: Middle-positioned independent panel
  - Contains Advanced Search interface with search criteria forms
  - Shows Search Results section with file listings
  - Completely independent from Explorer Panel

- **Multi-Document Workspace**: Right-positioned main content area
  - Contains Document Caddy containers for open files
  - Expands to full width when no side panels are visible
  - Maintains consistent layout with document thumbnails and titles

#### Toolbar Controls
- **Top Navigation Bar**: Contains project title and panel toggle controls
  - "Files & Categories" toggle button controls Explorer Panel visibility
  - "Search" toggle button controls Search Panel visibility
  - Toggle states persist between sessions

#### Layout Behavior
- **Two-column layout**: (Files & Categories Panel OR Search Panel) | Multi-Document Workspace
- **Single-column layout**: Multi-Document Workspace (when both panels hidden)
- **Mutually exclusive panels**: Only one side panel can be visible at a time
- **Resizable borders**: Users can drag panel boundaries to adjust widths
- **Responsive behavior**: Layout adapts to window resizing while maintaining proportions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: Contains Source folder path and Reports folder path for file browsing
- **WorkspaceLayout**: Panel visibility states, panel dimensions, section visibility states, and layout preferences
- **DocumentCaddy**: Container for individual open documents in the workspace
- **FileExplorerItem**: Represents files from Source and Reports folders with display metadata
- **ExplorerPanelState**: Tracks File Explorer and Category Explorer section visibility within Explorer Panel

## Design Evolution & Rationale *(specification update)*

### Original Design vs. Final Design

**Original Specification (Initial Implementation):**
- Single left panel with tabbed interface (File Explorer | Category Explorer | Search as tabs)
- Two-column layout: Tabbed Panel | Multi-Document Workspace
- Bottom-positioned tabs within the left panel

**Updated Design (Based on User Requirements):**
- Two independent panels: Explorer Panel (File Explorer + Category Explorer sections) and Search Panel
- Three-column layout capability: Explorer Panel | Search Panel | Multi-Document Workspace
- Top toolbar toggles for panel visibility control

### Rationale for Design Changes

1. **File-Category Interaction**: Users need to see both File Explorer and Category Explorer simultaneously within the same panel to enable drag-and-drop file categorization workflows, which was not possible with the original tabbed interface approach.

2. **Workflow Optimization**: Different user tasks benefit from different panel modes:
   - File categorization workflows: Files & Categories panel visible (both File Explorer and Category Explorer sections)
   - Search-focused work: Search panel visible with advanced search capabilities
   - Clean document editing: Both panels hidden for distraction-free document workspace

3. **Mutual Exclusivity**: The Files & Categories panel and Search panel are mutually exclusive to maintain focus and avoid interface complexity, with clear toggle controls for switching between modes.

4. **Flexible Section Control**: Within the Files & Categories panel, users can independently show/hide File Explorer and Category Explorer sections. When both sections are visible, drag-and-drop file categorization becomes possible.

### Architectural Impact

- **State Management**: Requires tracking both panel-level and section-level visibility states
- **Layout Engine**: Must support dynamic column layouts (1-3 columns based on panel visibility)
- **Persistence**: Panel and section states must be preserved across sessions
- **Responsive Design**: Layout must gracefully handle window resizing across all column configurations
