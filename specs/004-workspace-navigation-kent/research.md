# Phase 0: Research & Technical Decisions

**Feature**: Project Workspace Navigation (MVP - Iteration 1)
**Date**: 2025-09-25

## Research Findings

### File System Navigation Approach

**Decision**: Use Tauri's native file system APIs through structured commands
**Rationale**:
- Tauri provides secure, sandboxed file system access
- Native performance for directory listing and file metadata
- Cross-platform compatibility built-in
- Aligns with existing project-list implementation patterns

**Alternatives considered**:
- Browser File System API: Rejected due to security limitations and desktop focus
- Direct Node.js fs module: Not applicable in Tauri context

### Navigation State Management

**Decision**: Extend existing Zustand store pattern with workspace slice
**Rationale**:
- Consistent with project-list feature state management
- Type-safe state transitions with TypeScript
- Optimistic UI updates with error rollback
- Clean separation of navigation concerns

**Alternatives considered**:
- React Router state: Rejected due to complexity for desktop app navigation
- Local component state: Rejected due to need for cross-component workspace context

### File Metadata Display Strategy

**Decision**: Basic metadata display (name, size, modified date) via Tauri fs API
**Rationale**:
- Sufficient for MVP requirements
- Platform-native metadata access through Tauri
- No external dependencies required
- Consistent with functional requirements FR-007

**Alternatives considered**:
- Rich file previews: Deferred to future iteration (outside MVP scope)
- File content indexing: Not needed for basic navigation requirements

### Error Handling Patterns

**Decision**: Structured error handling following existing AppError patterns
**Rationale**:
- Consistency with project-list error handling
- Clear user feedback for file system issues
- Specific error types for different failure modes (access denied, not found, network issues)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic error messages: Rejected due to poor user experience
- Silent failure handling: Rejected due to functional requirements FR-006

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Lazy loading with pagination for large directories
**Rationale**:
- Meets performance constraint of <2s loading for <100 files
- Graceful degradation for 1000+ file directories
- Progressive loading maintains responsiveness

**Alternatives considered**:
- Full directory loading: Rejected due to performance constraints with large directories
- Virtual scrolling: Deferred to future iteration (outside MVP scope)

## Technical Integration Points

### Existing Dependencies
- **Project List System**: Will receive project data (ProjectId, source folder path) for workspace initialization
- **SQLite Database**: Project metadata already available, no schema changes needed
- **Tauri Commands**: Will extend existing command patterns with file system operations

### New Dependencies
- No additional external dependencies required
- All functionality achievable with existing tech stack

## Architecture Decisions

### Domain Layer Design
- **WorkspaceContext**: Value object containing project context and current navigation state
- **FileEntry**: Entity representing file/folder with metadata
- **DirectoryListing**: Aggregate root for file collection with navigation operations

### Command Interface Design
- `open_workspace(project_id: String) -> Result<WorkspaceDto, AppError>`
- `list_directory(path: String) -> Result<DirectoryListingDto, AppError>`
- `navigate_to_folder(workspace_id: String, folder_path: String) -> Result<DirectoryListingDto, AppError>`

### UI Component Architecture
- **WorkspacePage**: Main workspace container
- **ProjectHeader**: Project context display component
- **FileList**: File/folder listing with navigation
- **NavigationBreadcrumb**: Current location indicator

## Validation

All research decisions align with:
- ✅ Constitutional DDD requirements
- ✅ Existing codebase patterns and dependencies
- ✅ Functional requirements from specification
- ✅ Performance constraints and scalability needs
- ✅ MVP scope limitations (no advanced features)

## Next Phase Readiness

- [x] All technical unknowns resolved
- [x] Integration points identified
- [x] Architecture approach validated
- [x] No external dependency research needed
- [x] Performance strategy defined

**Status**: Phase 0 Complete - Ready for Phase 1 Design
