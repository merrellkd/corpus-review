**Feature Branch**: `004-workspace-navigation-kent`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "workspace-navigation @kent-notes/core-system-features/iteration-1-workspace-navigation-mvp.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature description loaded from iteration-1-workspace-navigation-mvp.md
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identified: workspace navigation, project context, file browser, navigation states
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ No major clarifications needed - MVP scope well-defined
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear user flow: project list ’ workspace ’ file browsing ’ back navigation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ 10 functional requirements derived from MVP scope
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ’ Project Workspace, File Listing, Navigation State identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All sections completed, no implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a corpus analyst, I need to open my projects from the project list so I can access my documents and begin Corpus Review work in a dedicated workspace environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have projects in my project list, **When** I click "Open Project", **Then** the system navigates me to a project workspace showing my project files
2. **Given** I am in a project workspace, **When** I want to return to project selection, **Then** I can navigate back to the project list
3. **Given** I open a project, **When** the workspace loads, **Then** I can see the project name, source folder, and a basic file listing
4. **Given** a project's source folder is inaccessible, **When** I try to open it, **Then** the system shows a clear error message

### Edge Cases
- What happens when source folder has been moved or deleted since project creation?
- How does system handle projects with very large numbers of files (1000+ files)?
- What occurs when user lacks read permissions for source folder?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide "Open Project" action from project list that navigates to project workspace
- **FR-002**: System MUST display project workspace with project name and source folder path
- **FR-003**: System MUST show basic file browser listing contents of source folder
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide "Back to Projects" navigation from workspace to project list
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate source folder accessibility before loading workspace
- **FR-006**: System MUST display clear error message when source folder is inaccessible
- **FR-007**: System MUST show file names, types, and basic metadata (size, modified date) in file listing
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle empty source folders gracefully
- **FR-009**: System MUST support basic folder navigation within source folder structure
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain project context throughout workspace session

### Key Entities
- **Project Workspace**: The dedicated working environment for a specific project containing project metadata and file browser
- **File Listing**: Display of files and folders within the project's source directory with basic metadata
- **Navigation State**: System's tracking of current location (project list vs specific workspace) and current folder within project
