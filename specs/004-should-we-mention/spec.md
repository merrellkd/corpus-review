# Feature Specification: Project Workspace Navigation

**Feature Branch**: `004-should-we-mention`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Should we mention in the spec that the project list should also provide the ability to actually navigate to the project in the Project Workspace?"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a corpus analyst, I need to open and navigate to my projects from the project list so I can begin working on my corpus analysis within the dedicated project workspace environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have created projects in my project list, **When** I click on a project to open it, **Then** the system navigates me to the Project Workspace for that specific project
2. **Given** I am viewing the project list, **When** I select "Open Project" for a specific project, **Then** the system loads the project workspace with all relevant project files and analysis tools available
3. **Given** I have multiple projects open, **When** I navigate between them, **Then** the system maintains the state of each project workspace independently
4. **Given** I am working in a Project Workspace, **When** I return to the project list, **Then** the system preserves my workspace state for when I return to that project

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to open a project whose source folder has been moved or deleted?
- How does system handle opening a project that is already open in another window/session?
- What occurs when project workspace fails to load due to permissions or corrupted project data?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a primary "Open Project" action for each project in the project list
- **FR-002**: System MUST navigate users to the dedicated Project Workspace when opening a project
- **FR-003**: System MUST load project-specific context and data when entering a Project Workspace
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain separate workspace states for different projects when multiple are accessed
- **FR-005**: System MUST preserve workspace state when users navigate away from and return to a project
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate project accessibility before attempting to open the workspace
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messaging when project cannot be opened
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to return to project list from any Project Workspace
- **FR-009**: System MUST indicate which projects are currently open or active [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: single vs multiple concurrent project access pattern]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle navigation between Project Workspace and project list seamlessly

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project Workspace**: The dedicated working environment for a specific project, containing all analysis tools and project-specific interface elements
- **Navigation State**: The system's tracking of user location and workspace states across different projects and views
- **Project Session**: The active connection between a project and its workspace, maintaining user progress and interface state
