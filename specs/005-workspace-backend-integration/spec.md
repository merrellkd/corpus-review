# Feature Specification: Workspace Backend Integration

**Feature Branch**: `005-workspace-backend-integration`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Active
**Input**: Integrate real file system backend with existing rich workspace UI

## Problem Statement

The application currently has two separate workspace systems:

1. **Rich UI Workspace (001-project-workspace)**: Complete multi-panel interface with mock data
2. **Basic Navigation (004-workspace-navigation-kent)**: Simple file browser with real backend

Users need the **rich UI experience** with **real file system integration**.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Flow
1. **User clicks "Browse Files"** on a project from the project list
2. **Rich workspace opens** showing the multi-panel interface
3. **File Explorer shows real files** from the project's source folder
4. **User can navigate folders** and see actual directory contents
5. **User can toggle panels** (Files & Categories, Search) as before
6. **User can return to project list** via "Return to Project List" button

### Test Scenarios
- **Real File Loading**: File Explorer displays actual files from project source folder
- **Directory Navigation**: Users can browse into subdirectories and see real contents
- **Panel State Persistence**: Panel visibility and sizes persist between sessions
- **Performance**: File loading completes within 2 seconds for typical directories
- **Error Handling**: Inaccessible folders show appropriate error messages
- **Multi-Project**: Switching between projects loads correct file structures

## Functional Requirements

### Core Integration Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST replace mock data in workspace store with real Tauri file system calls
- **FR-002**: System MUST use existing `open_workspace_navigation` and `list_directory` Tauri commands
- **FR-003**: System MUST preserve all existing rich UI components (FilesCategoriesPanel, TopToolbar, etc.)
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain panel state persistence and resizing functionality
- **FR-005**: System MUST show real file and folder hierarchy from project source folder

### File System Integration
- **FR-006**: File Explorer MUST display actual files and folders from project source directory
- **FR-007**: System MUST support navigation into subdirectories with real content
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle file system errors gracefully (permissions, missing folders)
- **FR-009**: System MUST update file listings when navigating between folders
- **FR-010**: System MUST respect file system boundaries (stay within project source folder)

### UI Consistency Requirements
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain all existing UI layouts and panel arrangements
- **FR-012**: System MUST preserve Files & Categories and Search panel toggle functionality
- **FR-013**: System MUST keep Document Workspace area for future multi-document features
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain responsive design and panel resizing capabilities

## Key Entities

### Primary Entities (Existing)
- **Project**: Projects from database with real source folders
- **WorkspaceLayout**: Panel state, visibility, and sizing preferences
- **FileSystemItem**: Real files and folders from project directories
- **DocumentCaddy**: Future multi-document containers (placeholder maintained)

### Integration Entities (New/Modified)
- **WorkspaceContext**: Bridge between project data and file system operations
- **FileExplorerState**: Real directory navigation state and history
- **PanelState**: Unified state management for all workspace panels

## Success Criteria

### User Experience
- Users see their **actual project files** in the rich workspace interface
- All **panel toggles and resizing** continue to work as before
- **File navigation** works smoothly with real directory browsing
- **Performance** is responsive (< 2s file loading, < 500ms navigation)

### Technical Integration
- **Zero breaking changes** to existing UI components
- **Reuse 100%** of working backend commands from 004-workspace-navigation-kent
- **Maintain compatibility** with existing panel state persistence
- **Clean separation** between UI layer and file system operations

### Quality Assurance
- **All existing tests** continue to pass with real data
- **New integration tests** validate end-to-end file system workflows
- **Contract tests** ensure backend compatibility is maintained
- **Performance tests** validate file loading and navigation responsiveness

## Implementation Approach

This integration will be accomplished by:

1. **Store Integration**: Replace mock data in `workspaceStore.ts` with real Tauri calls
2. **Component Updates**: Connect `FilesCategoriesPanel.tsx` to real file data
3. **State Management**: Ensure unified panel state works with real file operations
4. **Test Migration**: Update existing tests to work with real file system integration

The approach preserves all existing UI investments while adding real functionality.

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies
- **001-project-workspace**: Rich UI components and layout system
- **004-workspace-navigation-kent**: Working Tauri commands and file system backend
- **003-project-list**: Project selection and navigation integration

### External Dependencies
- Existing Tauri file system APIs
- React resizable panels library
- Zustand state management
- Project database with valid source folder paths
