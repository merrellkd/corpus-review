**Feature**: 002-multi-document-workspace
**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Quick Validation Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Layout Mode Switching
**Purpose**: Verify that users can switch between all three layout modes
**Prerequisites**: Empty workspace, sample documents available

1. **Setup**:
   - Launch Corpus Review application
   - Navigate to Multi-Document Workspace
   - Verify command bar shows three layout mode icons

2. **Execute**:
   - Open 3 sample documents from File Explorer
   - Click Grid layout mode icon
   - Verify documents arrange in 3-column grid
   - Click Stacked layout mode icon
   - Verify only one document visible, others stacked
   - Click Freeform layout mode icon
   - Verify documents maintain individual positions

3. **Validate**:
   - ✅ All layout modes functional
   - ✅ Active mode highlighted in command bar
   - ✅ Smooth transitions between modes
   - ✅ Document content preserved across switches

### Scenario 2: Automatic Freeform Mode Switching
**Purpose**: Verify system auto-switches to freeform when user manipulates documents
**Prerequisites**: Workspace with 2+ documents in non-freeform mode

1. **Setup**:
   - Open workspace with 3 documents
   - Switch to Grid layout mode
   - Verify documents in grid arrangement

2. **Execute**:
   - Drag one document to a new position
   - Verify layout mode automatically switches to Freeform
   - Switch back to Stacked mode
   - Resize one document
   - Verify layout mode automatically switches to Freeform

3. **Validate**:
   - ✅ Dragging triggers auto-switch to freeform
   - ✅ Resizing triggers auto-switch to freeform
   - ✅ Command bar updates to show freeform as active
   - ✅ User positioning preserved after auto-switch

### Scenario 3: Document Management Operations
**Purpose**: Verify core document operations work correctly
**Prerequisites**: Empty workspace

1. **Setup**:
   - Start with empty workspace
   - Have 5+ sample documents available

2. **Execute**:
   - Open 5 documents from File Explorer
   - Click on different documents to activate them
   - Verify active document highlighted and brought to front
   - Open a document that's already open
   - Verify focus moves to existing document (no duplicate)
   - Click "Close all" button
   - Confirm in dialog
   - Verify all documents removed

3. **Validate**:
   - ✅ Documents open in current layout mode
   - ✅ Document activation works properly
   - ✅ No duplicate documents created
   - ✅ Close all requires confirmation
   - ✅ Workspace cleared after close all

### Scenario 4: Layout Mode Behaviors
**Purpose**: Verify each layout mode behaves according to specification
**Prerequisites**: Workspace with 4 documents

1. **Stacked Mode Test**:
   - Switch to Stacked mode
   - Verify only active document fully visible
   - Click tab/navigation to switch documents
   - Verify smooth document switching
   - Verify inactive documents properly stacked

2. **Grid Mode Test**:
   - Switch to Grid mode
   - Verify documents arranged in even grid
   - Resize workspace window
   - Verify grid adjusts to new dimensions
   - Add one more document
   - Verify grid recalculates for 5 documents

3. **Freeform Mode Test**:
   - Switch to Freeform mode
   - Drag documents to custom positions
   - Resize documents to different sizes
   - Switch to another mode and back
   - Verify custom positions/sizes preserved

4. **Validate**:
   - ✅ Stacked mode shows one document at a time
   - ✅ Grid mode maintains even spacing
   - ✅ Freeform mode preserves user customizations
   - ✅ Layout adjusts to workspace resize

### Scenario 5: Performance and Responsiveness
**Purpose**: Verify performance goals are met
**Prerequisites**: Capability to measure performance

1. **Setup**:
   - Open 20+ documents in workspace
   - Use browser dev tools or performance monitoring

2. **Execute**:
   - Switch between layout modes multiple times
   - Measure transition duration
   - Drag documents in freeform mode
   - Measure response time
   - Activate different documents rapidly
   - Monitor UI responsiveness

3. **Validate**:
   - ✅ Layout switching completes within 16ms
   - ✅ Document dragging feels smooth (60fps)
   - ✅ No visible lag during interactions
   - ✅ Memory usage remains stable

## Integration Test Scenarios

### End-to-End User Journey
**Story**: Researcher comparing multiple documents

1. **Research Setup**:
   - Open Corpus Review for document analysis project
   - Navigate to Multi-Document Workspace
   - Open 6 research papers from File Explorer

2. **Initial Review**:
   - Use Stacked mode to focus on one paper at a time
   - Navigate through papers using tabs
   - Take notes on each paper

3. **Comparison Phase**:
   - Switch to Grid mode to see all papers simultaneously
   - Identify papers that need detailed comparison
   - Switch to Freeform mode
   - Arrange 3 key papers side-by-side
   - Resize papers for optimal reading

4. **Final Organization**:
   - Group related papers by dragging positions
   - Switch back to Grid mode for final overview
   - Close irrelevant papers individually
   - Use "Close all" to clear workspace when done

5. **Validate Complete Workflow**:
   - ✅ All layout modes support research workflow
   - ✅ Document state preserved throughout session
   - ✅ Layout preferences remembered in freeform
   - ✅ No data loss or UI glitches
   - ✅ Performance acceptable with 6+ documents
