# Feature Specification: Multi-Document Workspace Layout Management

**Feature Branch**: `002-multi-document-workspace`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Multi-Document Workspace Layout Management Specification - Purpose: Enable users to efficiently organize and view multiple documents simultaneously through structured layout modes within the Corpus Review application's Multi-Document Workspace (MDW)."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature description provided and parsed successfully
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identified: researchers, layout modes, document organization, workspace management
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � No major ambiguities - requirements are well-defined
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Clear user flows for layout switching and document management
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � All requirements are testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � DocumentCaddy, LayoutMode, Workspace entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   � No major uncertainties or implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A researcher wants to review and compare multiple documents simultaneously. They open several documents from the File Explorer, switch between different layout modes (Stacked, Grid, Freeform) to organize their workspace according to their current task, and efficiently navigate between documents while maintaining their preferred organization.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the MDW is open with no documents, **When** a user clicks a file in the File Explorer, **Then** the document opens as a DocumentCaddy positioned according to the current layout mode
2. **Given** multiple documents are open in Stacked mode, **When** a user clicks the Grid layout mode icon, **Then** all DocumentCaddies immediately rearrange into an organized grid pattern
3. **Given** documents are arranged in Freeform mode, **When** a user drags a DocumentCaddy to a new position, **Then** the DocumentCaddy moves to the new location and maintains that position when switching away from and back to Freeform mode
4. **Given** multiple documents are open, **When** a user clicks "Close all" in the command bar, **Then** a confirmation dialog appears and upon confirmation, all DocumentCaddies are removed from the workspace
5. **Given** a document is already open, **When** a user clicks the same file in the File Explorer, **Then** focus moves to the existing DocumentCaddy instead of creating a duplicate

### Edge Cases

- What happens when switching layout modes with only one document open?
- How does the system handle resizing the workspace window in different layout modes?
- What occurs when a user attempts to position a DocumentCaddy outside the visible workspace in Freeform mode?
- How does the system behave when the workspace contains many documents and switches to Grid mode?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a command bar at the top of the MDW with clearly labeled layout mode icons (Stacked, Grid, Freeform) and a Close all action
- **FR-002**: System MUST visually indicate the currently active layout mode in the command bar
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically rearrange all existing DocumentCaddies when a user switches layout modes
- **FR-004**: System MUST arrange documents in a stack-like interface in Stacked mode where only one document is fully visible at a time
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide tab or stack navigation to switch between documents in Stacked mode
- **FR-006**: System MUST clearly distinguish the active document from inactive ones in Stacked mode
- **FR-007**: System MUST arrange multiple documents in an organized grid pattern in Grid mode
- **FR-008**: System MUST automatically adjust the grid to accommodate the number of open documents with evenly sized and spaced cells
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow manual positioning of DocumentCaddies anywhere within the workspace in Freeform mode
- **FR-010**: System MUST support drag-and-drop repositioning of DocumentCaddies in Freeform mode
- **FR-011**: System MUST support manual resizing of DocumentCaddies in Freeform mode.
- **FR-012**: System MUST preserve user-defined positions and sizes when switching away from and back to Freeform mode
- **FR-013**: System MUST open documents as DocumentCaddies positioned according to the currently active layout mode when files are clicked in the File Explorer
- **FR-014**: System MUST bring focus to existing DocumentCaddies rather than creating duplicates when opening already-open documents
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide confirmation before executing the Close all action to prevent accidental data loss
- **FR-016**: System MUST remove all DocumentCaddies from the workspace when Close all is confirmed
- **FR-017**: System MUST include a placeholder for the Named Workspaces feature positioned according to the design without interfering with core functionality
- **FR-018**: System MUST preserve document content and state across all layout changes
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide smooth and visually clear transitions between layout modes
- **FR-020**: System MUST provide visual feedback during layout transitions
- **FR-021**: System MUST implement hover states for all interactive elements in the command bar
- **FR-022**: System MUST automatically switch to Freeform layout mode when a user resizes or moves a DocumentCaddy while in Stacked or Grid mode

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **DocumentCaddy**: Represents an individual document container with position, size, visibility state, and document content reference
- **LayoutMode**: Represents the three layout configurations (Stacked, Grid, Freeform) with their specific arrangement rules and behaviors
- **Workspace**: Represents the overall MDW container that manages DocumentCaddies, maintains layout state, and coordinates layout transitions
- **Named Workspaces Placeholder**: Represents the reserved UI space for future Named Workspaces integration
