# Research: Multi-Document Workspace Layout Management

**Feature**: 002-multi-document-workspace
**Date**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Complete

## Layout Management Architecture Research

### Decision: React Context + Zustand Hybrid Approach
**Rationale**: Combine React's built-in layout context with Zustand for global state management. React context handles immediate layout coordination while Zustand persists layout preferences and manages cross-component state.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure React Context (insufficient for persistence)
- Pure Zustand (less efficient for frequent layout updates)
- Redux Toolkit (unnecessary complexity for desktop app)

### Decision: CSS Grid + Flexbox for Layout Engines
**Rationale**: CSS Grid provides precise control for Grid layout mode, Flexbox handles Stacked mode efficiently, and CSS transforms enable smooth transitions. Native CSS performance superior to JavaScript-based layout libraries.
**Alternatives considered**:
- React Layouts library (additional dependency, less control)
- Manual positioning (poor performance, complex calculations)
- Canvas-based layouts (accessibility concerns, complexity)

### Decision: react-resizable-panels for DocumentCaddy Interactions
**Rationale**: Already in dependencies, well-tested for drag/resize operations, integrates with React state, supports touch interactions for future tablet support.
**Alternatives considered**:
- react-rnd (additional dependency)
- Custom drag/resize implementation (development time, edge cases)
- react-draggable + react-resizable (multiple dependencies)

## Domain-Driven Design Research

### Decision: Workspace Aggregate Root Pattern
**Rationale**: Workspace acts as aggregate root managing DocumentCaddy entities, enforcing layout mode invariants, and coordinating state transitions. Follows DDD principles while maintaining performance.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate aggregates per layout mode (violation of consistency boundaries)
- DocumentCaddy as aggregate root (poor encapsulation of layout rules)
- Flat entity structure (no business rule enforcement)

### Decision: Layout Mode Value Object with Strategy Pattern
**Rationale**: Layout modes are value objects with immutable behavior. Strategy pattern allows pluggable layout algorithms while maintaining type safety and testability.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Enum-based modes (limited extensibility)
- Class inheritance (violates favor composition principle)
- Functional switches (poor encapsulation)

## State Persistence Research

### Decision: Local Storage + SQLite Hybrid Persistence
**Rationale**: Workspace preferences in localStorage for immediate access, document metadata in SQLite for reliability. Tauri provides secure file system access for workspace snapshots.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Pure localStorage (data loss risk, size limits)
- Pure SQLite (performance overhead for UI state)
- File-based JSON (manual serialization, corruption risk)

## Performance Optimization Research

### Decision: Virtual Scrolling for Large Document Sets
**Rationale**: When 50+ documents open, virtualize document rendering to maintain 60fps. Use react-window with dynamic sizing for variable DocumentCaddy dimensions.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Pagination (poor UX for workspace overview)
- Progressive loading (complexity, state management issues)
- No optimization (performance degradation)

### Decision: CSS Transforms for Layout Transitions
**Rationale**: Hardware-accelerated transforms provide smooth 16ms transitions. Use transform3d for GPU acceleration, avoid layout thrashing during mode switches.
**Alternatives considered**:
- JavaScript animation libraries (performance overhead)
- Web Animations API (browser compatibility)
- Immediate layout switching (poor UX)

## Integration Patterns Research

### Decision: Command Pattern for Layout Operations
**Rationale**: Encapsulate layout operations as commands for undo/redo support, batch operations, and event sourcing. Enables future features like layout history.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Direct state mutations (no undo capability)
- Event sourcing only (complexity for simple operations)
- Memento pattern (memory overhead for large workspaces)

### Decision: Observer Pattern for DocumentCaddy Lifecycle
**Rationale**: DocumentCaddies observe workspace layout changes, automatically reposition on mode switches. Decouples layout logic from component rendering.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Props drilling (tight coupling, re-render cascades)
- Global event bus (debugging complexity)
- Parent component coordination (scalability issues)

## Testing Strategy Research

### Decision: Layered Testing with Vitest + Testing Library
**Rationale**: Unit tests for domain logic (layout algorithms), integration tests for React components, E2E tests for user workflows. Vitest provides fast feedback, Testing Library ensures accessibility.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Jest + Enzyme (outdated patterns)
- Cypress only (slow feedback loop)
- Manual testing (insufficient coverage)

**Research Status**: All major decisions resolved. Ready for Phase 1 design.
