# Feature Specification: Project List Management (MVP)

**Feature Branch**: `003-project-list-see`
**Created**: 2025-09-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "project-list See @kent-notes/core-system-features/iteration-1-project-list-mvp.md  and kent-notes/core-system-features/integration-architecture.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature description provided via markdown files
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: corpus analysts; Actions: create, view, open, delete projects; Data: projects with names and source folders; Constraints: MVP scope limitations
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � No unclear aspects - requirements well-defined in input documentation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � User flow clearly defined in source material
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � All requirements testable and derived from MVP specification
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Project entity with clear attributes defined
7. Run Review Checklist
   � No implementation details included, focused on user needs
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a corpus analyst, I need to create and manage basic project information so I can organize my work around specific document collections and access my project workspace efficiently.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I want to start using Corpus Review, **When** I create a new project with a name, source folder path, and optional note, **Then** the system stores the project information and displays it in my project list
2. **Given** I have created multiple projects, **When** I view the project list, **Then** I see all my projects with their names, source folder paths, creation dates, and notes (if provided)
3. **Given** I want to work on a specific project, **When** I click "Open Project" from the project list, **Then** the system navigates me to the project workspace
4. **Given** I no longer need a project, **When** I select delete and confirm the action, **Then** the system removes the project from the list and database

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user specifies a source folder that doesn't exist or becomes inaccessible?
- How does system handle attempts to create projects with duplicate names?
- What occurs when source folder path becomes invalid after project creation?
- How does system respond when user tries to create a project with an empty name?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new projects with name (required), source folder path (required), and optional note field
- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that source folder exists and is accessible during project creation
- **FR-003**: System MUST display a simple list of all created projects showing project name, source folder path, creation date, and note if provided
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide "Open Project" action that navigates to project workspace
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide "Delete Project" action with basic confirmation dialog
- **FR-006**: System MUST store project data persistently across application sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent creation of projects with empty or whitespace-only names
- **FR-008**: System MUST show clear error messages when project creation fails due to invalid folder paths
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide folder picker interface for source folder selection
- **FR-010**: System MUST display projects in creation order with newest first
- **FR-011**: System MUST limit project names to maximum 255 characters
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle up to 100 projects efficiently in the list view
- **FR-013**: System MUST accept optional note field with maximum 1000 characters for project descriptions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Project**: Represents a Corpus Review workspace containing name (string, required, max 255 characters), source folder path (string, required, must exist), optional note (string, max 1000 characters), creation timestamp (automatically set), and unique identifier for database storage
