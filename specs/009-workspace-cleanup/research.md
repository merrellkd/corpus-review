# Research: Remove ProjectWorkspace Compatibility Layer

## File Removal Strategy

**Decision**: Direct file deletion with import validation
**Rationale**: Simple cleanup task with clear target file and well-defined import structure
**Alternatives considered**: Gradual deprecation (rejected - already implemented in previous consolidation)

## Import Update Approach

**Decision**: Update imports that still use old compatibility layer path
**Rationale**: Ensures all code uses canonical feature-based imports after removal
**Alternatives considered**: Leave broken imports for developers to fix (rejected - poor developer experience)

## Validation Strategy

**Decision**: TypeScript compilation and test validation after removal
**Rationale**: Ensures no functionality is broken and all imports resolve correctly
**Alternatives considered**: Manual validation only (rejected - insufficient coverage)

## Dependencies Analysis

**Decision**: No external dependencies for this cleanup task
**Rationale**: File removal affects only internal import references
**Alternatives considered**: N/A

## Testing Approach

**Decision**: Verify existing tests pass and TypeScript compiles after removal
**Rationale**: Confirms functionality preservation during cleanup
**Alternatives considered**: Create new tests specifically for removal (rejected - unnecessary overhead)

## Research Complete
All technical decisions are straightforward for this cleanup task. No additional unknowns requiring research.
