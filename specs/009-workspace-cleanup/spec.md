# Feature Specification: Remove ProjectWorkspace Compatibility Layer

**Feature Branch**: `009-let-s-go`
**Created**: 2025-09-27
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "let's go ahead and remove frontend/src/components/ProjectWorkspace.tsx"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Remove temporary compatibility layer file
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: developers; Actions: remove/cleanup; Data: compatibility file; Constraints: maintain functionality
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Removal approach is clear - delete compatibility layer
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Developer workflow after compatibility layer removal
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Compatibility layer file, import references
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Implementation-focused cleanup task
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on the codebase, I need the temporary ProjectWorkspace compatibility layer to be removed so that the project workspace component consolidation is fully complete and all imports use the new feature-based structure without legacy re-exports.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the ProjectWorkspace component has been successfully consolidated to the feature folder, **When** the compatibility layer is removed, **Then** all imports must use the new feature path
2. **Given** developers are importing ProjectWorkspace functionality, **When** they try to import from the old components path, **Then** they should receive clear import errors directing them to the new path
3. **Given** the compatibility layer is removed, **When** the application is built and tested, **Then** all functionality should work identically to before

### Edge Cases
- What happens when existing code still uses old import paths after removal?
- How does system handle any remaining references to the old compatibility layer?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove the temporary compatibility layer file at frontend/src/components/ProjectWorkspace.tsx
- **FR-002**: System MUST ensure all existing imports have been updated to use the new feature path
- **FR-003**: System MUST validate that no functionality is broken after compatibility layer removal
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide clear error messages for any remaining old import attempts
- **FR-005**: System MUST maintain all existing ProjectWorkspace component functionality
- **FR-006**: System MUST verify TypeScript compilation passes after removal
- **FR-007**: System MUST confirm all tests continue to pass after compatibility layer removal

### Key Entities
- **Compatibility Layer File**: Temporary re-export file that needs to be removed
- **Import References**: Any remaining code that imports from the old path
- **Feature Exports**: The new canonical location for ProjectWorkspace functionality
