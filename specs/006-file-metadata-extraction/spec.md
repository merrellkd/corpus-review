# Feature Specification: File Metadata Extraction

**Feature Branch**: `006-file-metadata-extraction`
**Created**: 2025-09-25
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "File Metadata Extraction"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature: Extract metadata and content from document files for analysis
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: corpus analysts, researchers
   � Actions: extract, convert, view, edit, annotate
   � Data: PDF, DOCX, Markdown files, extracted content, metadata
   � Constraints: file format limitations, storage alongside originals
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Performance targets for large documents
   � Batch processing requirements
   � Advanced metadata extraction scope
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary workflow: file selection � extraction � viewing/editing
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � 15 testable requirements covering extraction, conversion, and viewing
6. Identify Key Entities
   � Documents, extracted content, extraction status, viewing modes
7. Run Review Checklist
   � Spec focuses on user needs without implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines

-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a corpus analyst, I need to convert my PDF, DOCX, and Markdown documents into a standardized editable format so I can perform detailed annotation and analysis work on my research materials.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have PDF files in my project workspace, **When** I trigger extraction on a document, **Then** the system creates an editable version with extracted text content preserved
2. **Given** I have DOCX files with formatting in my project, **When** I extract the content, **Then** the system creates an editable version preserving basic structure like headings and lists
3. **Given** I have Markdown files in my workspace, **When** I extract them, **Then** the system converts the markdown syntax into a standardized editable format
4. **Given** extraction completes successfully for a file, **When** I view my workspace, **Then** I can see both the original file and the extracted version with clear visual indicators
5. **Given** I have both original and extracted versions of a document, **When** I open the original, **Then** I can view it in read-only mode, and **When** I open the extracted version, **Then** I can edit and annotate it
6. **Given** extraction fails for a file, **When** I check the extraction status, **Then** I see a clear error message explaining what went wrong and how to address it

### Edge Cases

- What happens when PDF files are password-protected or encrypted?
- How does the system handle corrupted or malformed document files?
- What occurs when Markdown files contain embedded images or unsupported syntax?
- How does the system respond to very large documents that may cause performance issues?
- What occurs when extraction produces poor quality text content? (System should complete extraction and rely on human correction)
- What happens when extraction produces completely empty content? (System should message the user and create an blank .det file)

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST extract text content from PDF files and create editable versions
- **FR-002**: System MUST extract text content from DOCX files preserving basic formatting structure
- **FR-003**: System MUST extract content from Markdown files and convert them to the standardized editable format
- **FR-004**: System MUST create extracted versions in a consistent format that supports rich text editing
- **FR-005**: System MUST store extracted files alongside original files in the same directory
- **FR-006**: System MUST track extraction status for each file (not started, processing, completed, error)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages when extraction fails with specific guidance
- **FR-008**: System MUST show extraction status indicators in the workspace file browser
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow manual triggering of extraction for individual files
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle basic document structure (paragraphs, headings, lists) during extraction
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate that extracted content is not empty or corrupted
- **FR-012**: Document viewer MUST display original files as read-only with appropriate viewing capabilities
- **FR-013**: Document editor MUST open extracted files with full editing and annotation capabilities
- **FR-014**: Document viewer MUST render original Markdown files as formatted text for read-only viewing
- **FR-015**: System MUST ignore embedded images in Markdown files during extraction and warn users about skipped content
- **FR-016**: System MUST complete extraction even when text quality is poor, allowing human users to manually correct extraction errors

### Performance Requirements

- **PR-001**: Extraction MUST complete within 30 seconds for typical documents under 100 pages [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: definition of "typical" document complexity]
- **PR-002**: Status updates MUST appear within 2 seconds of operation start
- **PR-003**: File browser updates MUST refresh within 1 second after extraction completion
- **PR-004**: System MUST handle documents up to 10MB without memory issues [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: behavior for larger files]

### Key Entities

- **Original Document**: Source PDF, DOCX, or Markdown file stored in project workspace with metadata like file size, creation date, and format type
- **Extracted Document**: Processed version of original in standardized editable format, linked to its source with extraction timestamp and method information
- **Extraction Status**: Processing state tracking for each document including pending, processing, completed, or error states with associated timestamps
- **Document Viewer Session**: User interaction context for viewing original files in read-only mode with appropriate format-specific rendering
- **Document Editing Session**: User interaction context for editing extracted files with annotation and modification capabilities
