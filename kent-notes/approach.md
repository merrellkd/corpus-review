[Image #1] Can we talk about feature-list for a little bit? I'm not asking you to update any documents right now. I just want your opinion. I believe much of the
value of this application will come from innovative, efficient, and delightful UI/UX. I've designed a lot of components in figma (of course with the help of AI)
that i believe add much to first-pass ai solutions. I think of them with DDD aggregates and entities and domain boundaries in mind, but they are also very much
interdependent upon other UI components. For example, files shown in the File Explorer have an 'Open' icon if they are open in the MDW. And if the Open icon is
showing in one panel, it is showing in the other panels as well. So my question is, if I am trying to start a new iteration focussing on Corpus Review, do I
decompose existing designs into Problem Solved/Key Benefit/User Outcom statements (as in pb-annotation-system/docs/clean-start/feature-list.md) or just spec them
out? (The SDD framework I will be using is https://github.com/github/spec-kit)

‚è∫ Looking at your image and understanding your focus on Corpus Review, I have a strong opinion on this: spec them out directly rather than decomposing into
problem/benefit statements first.

Here's why this approach makes sense for your situation:

Why Spec-First for UI-Centric Features

1. UI/UX Innovation is Your Core Value
   You're right that much of PAI-Brains' value comes from delightful, efficient UI/UX. Your Figma designs represent concrete solutions to user workflow problems.
   Breaking them down into abstract problem statements risks losing the innovative UI patterns you've already solved.

2. Interdependent UI Components Need Holistic Specs
   Your example of the File Explorer's "Open" icon syncing across panels is perfect - this kind of cross-component state coordination needs detailed specification,
   not high-level benefit statements. The GitHub Spec Kit format will capture these UI interdependencies much better.

3. Corpus Review Has Clear User Context
   Unlike discovery-phase features, Corpus Review has a well-defined user workflow. You're not asking "what problem should we solve?" but rather "how do we
   implement this sophisticated document review experience optimally?"

Recommended Approach for Corpus Review

Phase 1: Direct Specification

- Use GitHub Spec Kit to document your Figma designs
- Focus on component interactions and state synchronization
- Detail the cross-panel coordination patterns you've designed
- Specify the domain boundaries within the UI layer

Phase 2: DDD Mapping (Secondary)

- Map UI components to domain aggregates after spec is clear
- Identify shared state requirements across UI boundaries
- Design the Zustand stores that support the UI interactions

Why This Serves Your Constitution Better

Your constitution emphasizes "Visual-First UI Development" and "Documentation drives implementation." Your Figma designs ARE the documentation of user value -
they embody the problem-solving in visual form. Spec'ing them directly honors that visual-first principle.

The GitHub Spec Kit's format aligns well with your Enhanced Five Docs approach and will integrate cleanly with your DDD structure once you map UI specs to domain
services.

Bottom Line: Start with specs. Your UI innovations are too valuable to risk losing in abstract decomposition.
