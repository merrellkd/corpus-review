> Can you explain how we got to such a state so I don't repeat the mistake?

⏺ Absolutely! This is a great question and a valuable lesson. Here's exactly how we got into this state:

The Root Cause: Implementation Before Foundation

What Happened

1. Feature Implementation Rush: The team implemented feature 006-file-metadata-extraction by creating extensive new code (parsers, services,
   repositories) without ensuring the foundation compiled
2. Dependency Version Mismatches: The code was written against older versions of dependencies (pulldown_cmark, docx-rs) but the project uses
   newer versions with breaking API changes
3. Incomplete Integration: New domain objects and services were created but not properly integrated with existing infrastructure
4. Missing Abstractions: Code assumed methods and types existed that were never implemented

The Commit History Tells the Story

bd3ba32 006-file-metadata-etraction - /implement (first round) ← This broke everything
099acf9 006-file-metadata-extraction - Tasks
6ee1b37 006-file-metadata-extaction SPEC

The /implement commit added ~50 new files and thousands of lines of code without verifying compilation.

How to Prevent This

✅ The Right Way: Test-Driven Development

1. Red-Green-Refactor Cycle

# Always start with compilation

cargo check # Must pass

# Add ONE small piece

# Add failing test

cargo test # Should fail for right reason

# Implement just enough to pass

cargo check # Must pass
cargo test # Should pass

# Repeat

2. Incremental Integration

   - Add one entity at a time
   - Ensure each compiles before adding the next
   - Integration test after each addition

3. Dependency Management

# Check dependency versions FIRST

cargo tree

# Research API changes before coding

# Pin versions if needed

❌ What Went Wrong (The Anti-Pattern)

# This is what happened:

git commit -m "Implement entire feature suite"

# 50+ new files, 237+ compilation errors

# Now stuck - can't run, can't easily revert pieces

✅ The Better Approach

# Week 1: Foundation

git commit -m "Add DocumentId value object" # 0 errors
git commit -m "Add OriginalDocument entity" # 0 errors  
 git commit -m "Add basic repository trait" # 0 errors

# Week 2: Services

git commit -m "Add document service stub" # 0 errors
git commit -m "Implement document scanning" # 0 errors

# Week 3: Integration

git commit -m "Wire up Tauri commands" # 0 errors

# etc.

The Specific Technical Mistakes

1. API Assumptions: Code assumed pulldown_cmark::TagEnd existed (removed in v0.9+)
2. Method Naming: Services called .id() but entities only had .document_id()
3. Type Mismatches: Used String parameters but called with &str
4. Missing Implementations: Added trait bounds without implementing traits
5. Infrastructure Gaps: Added services without wiring them to AppState

Key Lessons

🎯 Golden Rules

1. Compilation First: Never commit code that doesn't compile
2. Small Commits: Each commit should add ~1 feature and compile cleanly
3. Verify Dependencies: Check API docs before using external crates
4. Integration Testing: Test that new code works with existing system
5. Feature Flags: Use feature flags for large incomplete features

🚨 Warning Signs

- Adding 10+ files in one commit
- "Will fix compilation errors later"
- Copy-pasting code without testing
- Not running cargo check frequently
- Assuming APIs without documentation

Recovery Strategy (For Future)

If you find yourself here again:

1. Stop adding features immediately
2. Run cargo check to see error count
3. If >50 errors: Consider reverting and starting over
4. If <50 errors: Fix systematically with tests

The good news: We've learned exactly what the issues were and how to avoid them. The foundation we built during our fixes is actually quite
solid - it's a great example of how to properly integrate new code with existing systems.
