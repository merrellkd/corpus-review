# Feature: Project Workspace Navigation (MVP - Iteration 1)

This MVP provides the essential bridge between the project list and project workspace, enabling users to actually access their projects for Corpus Review work. Advanced workspace features and multi-project management are deferred to later iterations.

## MVP Scope

This iteration delivers basic navigation functionality to connect project list to workspace:

- "Open Project" action from project list
- Basic project workspace view with project context
- Simple file browser showing source folder contents
- Basic navigation back to project list
- Project context display (name, source folder)

**Explicitly NOT in this iteration:**

- Multi-document workspace features
- Advanced file organization
- Workspace state persistence between sessions
- Multiple concurrent project access
- Document preview or editing capabilities
- Sophisticated file filtering or search

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a corpus analyst, I need to open my projects from the project list so I can access my documents and begin Corpus Review work in a dedicated workspace environment.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have projects in my project list, **When** I click "Open Project", **Then** the system navigates me to a project workspace showing my project files
2. **Given** I am in a project workspace, **When** I want to return to project selection, **Then** I can navigate back to the project list
3. **Given** I open a project, **When** the workspace loads, **Then** I can see the project name, source folder, and a basic file listing
4. **Given** a project's source folder is inaccessible, **When** I try to open it, **Then** the system shows a clear error message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when source folder has been moved or deleted since project creation?
- How does system handle projects with very large numbers of files (1000+ files)?
- What occurs when user lacks read permissions for source folder?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide "Open Project" action from project list that navigates to project workspace
- **FR-002**: System MUST display project workspace with project name and source folder path
- **FR-003**: System MUST show basic file browser listing contents of source folder
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide "Back to Projects" navigation from workspace to project list
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate source folder accessibility before loading workspace
- **FR-006**: System MUST display clear error message when source folder is inaccessible
- **FR-007**: System MUST show file names, types, and basic metadata (size, modified date) in file listing
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle empty source folders gracefully
- **FR-009**: System MUST support basic folder navigation within source folder structure
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain project context throughout workspace session

### Key Entities

- **Project Workspace**: The dedicated working environment for a specific project containing project metadata and file browser
- **File Listing**: Display of files and folders within the project's source directory
- **Navigation State**: System's tracking of current location (project list vs specific workspace)

## User Interface Requirements

### Project List Integration

- "Open Project" button/action for each project in list
- Clear visual indication when project is being loaded
- Loading state during workspace initialization

### Project Workspace Layout (Basic)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Back to Projects] │ Project: [Name]           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Source: /path/to/source/folder                  │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Files in Project:                               │
│                                                 │
│ 📁 subfolder1/                                  │
│ 📄 document1.pdf          1.2MB   2024-09-20   │
│ 📄 document2.docx         856KB   2024-09-21   │
│ 🎵 audio1.mp3             3.4MB   2024-09-19   │
│                                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Navigation Elements

- **Back to Projects**: Clear navigation element to return to project list
- **Project Context Bar**: Shows current project name and source folder
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Shows current folder location within source structure

### File Browser Features (Basic)

- File and folder listing with icons indicating file types
- Basic file information: name, size, modification date
- Folder navigation (click to enter subdirectories)
- Parent folder navigation ("Up" or "../" functionality)

## Error Handling

### Source Folder Issues

- **Folder Not Found**: "The source folder for this project could not be found. It may have been moved or deleted."
- **Access Denied**: "You don't have permission to access this project's source folder."
- **Network Issues**: "The source folder is currently inaccessible. Please check your network connection."

### Navigation Errors

- **Loading Failures**: Clear error message with option to retry or return to project list
- **Empty Folder**: Friendly message indicating folder is empty with suggestion to add files

## Data Requirements

### Project Context Data

- Project name
- Source folder path
- Folder accessibility status
- Basic file/folder listing

### Session Management (Basic)

- Current project ID
- Current navigation location within project
- Basic workspace state (which folder user is viewing)

## Technical Constraints

### MVP Limitations

- Single project access only (no multiple concurrent projects)
- No workspace state persistence between sessions
- Basic file system operations only (no advanced file management)
- No document preview or editing capabilities
- Simple folder navigation only (no search within folders)

### Performance Requirements

- Workspace loading within 2 seconds for folders with <100 files
- File listing refresh within 1 second
- Navigation between folders within 500ms
- Graceful handling of folders with 1000+ files (show loading state)

### Integration Points

- **Project List System**: Receives project data for workspace initialization
- **File System**: Basic read access to source folders and file metadata
- **Future File Processing**: Workspace structure ready for file metadata integration

## Success Criteria

### User Experience

- Seamless transition from project list to workspace
- Clear project context always visible in workspace
- Intuitive navigation between folders
- Obvious path back to project list

### Technical Performance

- Fast workspace loading for typical project sizes (50-500 files)
- Responsive file browser navigation
- Reliable error handling for common filesystem issues
- Clean separation between navigation and future file processing features

This MVP establishes the essential connection between project management and workspace functionality, providing users with immediate access to their project files while setting up the foundation for more advanced workspace features in later iterations.
