Plan Completed Successfully!

I've implemented the comprehensive Document Derivatives Management System as approved. Here's what was
accomplished:

🆕 New Features Created

1. kent-notes/document-derivatives-system.md - Complete document lifecycle specification with dedicated
   /derivatives/ folder structure, document families, and relationship tracking
2. kent-notes/integration-architecture.md - System integration overview showing how all components work
   together for unified search and discovery

🔄 Updated Features

3. kent-notes/reports-management-system.md - Clarified distinction between reports (analysis outputs) vs
   derivatives (document versions), updated coordination strategy
4. kent-notes/file-metadata-extraction-system.md - Extended with derivative relationship tracking, .det
   file generation, and metadata synchronization

🏗️ Key Architectural Decisions Implemented

- Dedicated /derivatives/ folder alongside /reports/ for clear separation of concerns
- Document families - each original gets its own subfolder grouping all related versions
- File system storage for derivatives as requested, with database coordination for search
- Unified metadata format across all systems using \_metadata.json and database sync
- Processing chain tracking for complete traceability from original → extracted → derivatives

The system now supports your sophisticated workflow: immutable originals → editable extractions → multiple
derivatives (summaries, anonymized versions, cost tables, etc.) while maintaining comprehensive relationship
tracking and unified search capabilities.

> What order do you recommend developing these features?

⏺ Based on the dependencies and user value, here's the recommended development order:

Phase 1: Foundation (Essential for any corpus work)

1. Project List Management - Users need to create and organize projects first
2. File Metadata Extraction System - Required for processing any files and understanding corpus content

Phase 2: Core Document Processing

3. Document Derivatives Management System - Enables the extracted.det workflow and basic derivative
   creation
4. Project Workspace Navigation - Connects project list to actual workspace (from spec 004)

Phase 3: Analysis and Reporting

5. Reports Management System - Analysis outputs and findings
6. Integration Architecture - Unified search and cross-system coordination

Rationale:

Phase 1 establishes the foundation - users can't do anything without projects and file processing.

Phase 2 enables the core document workflow (immutable → extracted → derivatives) which is your primary use
case. Navigation is needed to actually access the workspace.

Phase 3 adds the analysis layer and sophisticated search/discovery capabilities.

Alternative: MVP-First Approach

If you prefer faster time-to-value:

1. Project List Management (simplified - just CRUD, no fancy features)
2. Basic File Metadata Extraction (documents only, basic .det creation)
3. Project Workspace Navigation (get users into workspace quickly)
4. Then iterate back through the systems adding advanced features

The first approach gives you a complete system per feature. The second gets users working sooner but requires
more iteration.

Which approach aligns better with your development timeline and user needs?

> I prefer the second. It strikes me as an interlaced approach that I can conceptualize better.

⏺ Perfect! The interlaced/MVP-first approach will give you working software much faster and let you validate
each piece with real usage. Here's the refined development sequence:

Iteration 1: Basic Project Workspace

1. Project List Management (MVP) - Simple CRUD: create, list, open, delete projects
2. Project Workspace Navigation (MVP) - Basic "Open Project" that loads a workspace view
3. File Metadata Extraction (Documents Only) - Just PDF/DOCX → basic .det extraction

User Value: Users can create projects, see their files, and get basic document extraction working

Iteration 2: Core Document Workflow

4. Document Derivatives Management (MVP) - Basic extracted.det creation and simple derivative workflow
5. Project List Management (Enhanced) - Add search, status indicators, file counts
6. File Metadata Extraction (Enhanced) - Add audio/video metadata, relationship tracking

User Value: Complete document lifecycle from original → extracted → basic derivatives

Iteration 3: Advanced Features

7. Reports Management System (MVP) - Basic report creation and organization
8. Document Derivatives (Enhanced) - Advanced derivatives, document families, metadata tracking
9. Integration Architecture - Unified search, cross-system coordination

User Value: Complete analysis workflow with sophisticated search and organization

Benefits of This Approach:

- Fast feedback loops - users can test each increment
- Risk reduction - validate core assumptions early
- Conceptually clear - each iteration builds naturally on the previous
- Funding-friendly - demonstrable progress at regular intervals

Want to start with specs for the three MVP features in Iteration 1?
