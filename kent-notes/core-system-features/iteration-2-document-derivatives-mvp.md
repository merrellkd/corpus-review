# Feature: Document Derivatives Management (MVP - Iteration 2)

This iteration builds on the basic .det extraction from Iteration 1 to implement the core derivative workflow: original ‚Üí extracted ‚Üí basic derivatives. It introduces the derivatives folder structure and essential derivative creation capabilities.

## MVP Scope

This iteration delivers the foundational derivative management system:

- Migrate .det files from source folder to dedicated `/derivatives/` structure
- Basic document family organization (one folder per original document)
- Create simple derivatives: summaries and anonymized versions
- Basic parent-child relationship tracking
- Simple derivative creation workflow in workspace

**Explicitly NOT in this iteration:**

- Advanced derivative types (cost tables, explanatory documents)
- Complex processing chains (derivative of derivative)
- Advanced metadata tracking and search
- Sophisticated document family visualization
- Batch derivative creation
- Quality assessment and correction workflows

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a corpus analyst, I need to create organized derivatives of my documents (summaries, anonymized versions) so I can work with different versions while keeping them logically grouped and maintaining traceability to the original.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I have extracted.det files, **When** the system migrates to derivatives structure, **Then** each original document gets its own family folder with the extracted version
2. **Given** I have an extracted document, **When** I create a summary derivative, **Then** the system creates a new .det file in the same document family with appropriate naming
3. **Given** I want to anonymize a document, **When** I create an anonymized derivative, **Then** the system creates a copy I can edit to remove sensitive information
4. **Given** I have document families, **When** I browse the workspace, **Then** I can see the organized family structure and navigate between related documents

### Edge Cases

- What happens when original file is renamed or moved after derivatives are created?
- How does system handle derivatives when parent extracted.det file is regenerated?
- What occurs when user tries to create duplicate derivative types in same family?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST migrate existing .det files from source folder to `/derivatives/{document-id}/extracted.det` structure
- **FR-002**: System MUST create document family folders using unique document identifiers
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide "Create Summary" action from extracted.det files
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide "Create Anonymized Version" action from extracted.det files
- **FR-005**: System MUST create new derivative .det files with appropriate naming (summary-general.det, anonymized.det)
- **FR-006**: System MUST copy content from parent document to new derivative for editing
- **FR-007**: System MUST track basic parent-child relationships between documents
- **FR-008**: System MUST display document families in workspace with clear family grouping
- **FR-009**: System MUST create basic \_metadata.json files for each document family
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle navigation between family members in workspace

### Key Entities

- **Document Family**: Collection of related documents (original, extracted, derivatives) grouped in single folder
- **Document Identifier**: Unique ID for each original document used for folder naming
- **Derivative Type**: Category of derivative (summary, anonymized) with specific naming conventions
- **Family Metadata**: Basic information about document relationships stored in \_metadata.json

## Derivatives Folder Structure

### Migration from Iteration 1

```
Before (Iteration 1):
/source/
  document1.pdf
  document1.det  ‚Üê migrate this
  document2.docx
  document2.det  ‚Üê migrate this

After (Iteration 2):
/source/
  document1.pdf
  document2.docx
/derivatives/
  /doc_1/
    extracted.det
    _metadata.json
  /doc_2/
    extracted.det
    _metadata.json
```

### Document Family Structure (MVP)

```
/derivatives/
  /doc_{unique_id}/
    extracted.det           (base extraction from original)
    summary-general.det     (general summary derivative)
    anonymized.det          (anonymized derivative)
    _metadata.json             (family relationships and metadata)
```

### Naming Conventions

- **Document Family Folder**: `doc_{unique_id}` (e.g., doc_1, doc_2, doc_abc123)
- **Base Extraction**: `extracted.det`
- **Summary Derivative**: `summary-general.det` (expandable to summary-{topic}.det later)
- **Anonymized Derivative**: `anonymized.det`

## Basic Metadata Tracking

### \_metadata.json Structure (MVP)

```json
{
  "originalFile": {
    "path": "/source/document1.pdf",
    "name": "document1.pdf"
  },
  "extracted": {
    "filename": "extracted.det",
    "created": "2024-09-24T10:30:00Z",
    "status": "completed"
  },
  "derivatives": [
    {
      "filename": "summary-general.det",
      "type": "summary",
      "parentFile": "extracted.det",
      "created": "2024-09-24T11:00:00Z"
    },
    {
      "filename": "anonymized.det",
      "type": "anonymized",
      "parentFile": "extracted.det",
      "created": "2024-09-24T11:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## User Interface Requirements

### Workspace Document Browser (Enhanced)

#### Family-Based View

```
üìÅ /derivatives/
  üìÇ doc_1/ (document1.pdf family)
    üìÑ extracted.det
    üìù summary-general.det
    üîí anonymized.det
  üìÇ doc_2/ (document2.docx family)
    üìÑ extracted.det
```

#### Derivative Creation Actions

- **From extracted.det**: "Create Summary" and "Create Anonymized Version" buttons/menu
- **Visual Family Grouping**: Clear indication of document relationships
- **Navigation**: Easy movement between family members

### Derivative Creation Workflow

1. **Selection**: User selects extracted.det file in workspace
2. **Action Menu**: "Create Summary" or "Create Anonymized Version" options
3. **Creation**: System creates new .det file with copied content
4. **Opening**: Automatically open new derivative in TipTap editor for editing
5. **Metadata Update**: \_metadata.json updated with new derivative info

## Data Persistence

### Database Schema Addition

```sql
CREATE TABLE document_families (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,  -- doc_1, doc_2, etc.
  project_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
  original_file_path TEXT NOT NULL,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (project_id) REFERENCES projects(id)
);

CREATE TABLE document_derivatives (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  family_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  filename TEXT NOT NULL,
  derivative_type TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'extracted', 'summary', 'anonymized'
  parent_filename TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (family_id) REFERENCES document_families(id)
);
```

### Migration Process

- **Family ID Generation**: Create unique IDs for existing extracted.det files
- **File Movement**: Move .det files from source to derivatives folder structure
- **Metadata Initialization**: Create \_metadata.json files for migrated documents
- **Database Update**: Populate new tables with migrated document information

## Technical Constraints

### MVP Limitations

- Only two derivative types: summary and anonymized
- Single-level derivatives only (no derivative of derivative)
- Basic metadata tracking (no complex processing chains)
- Simple parent-child relationships (no complex family trees)
- Manual derivative creation only (no automated processing)

### Performance Requirements

- Family folder creation within 2 seconds
- Derivative creation (copy + metadata update) within 3 seconds
- Workspace family view loads within 1 second for 20+ families
- Migration completes within 10 seconds for 50+ documents

### File System Operations

- Reliable file movement during migration
- Atomic operations for derivative creation (file + metadata update)
- Handle concurrent access to family folders and metadata files
- Clean error handling during file operations

## Error Handling

### Migration Errors

- **File Move Failures**: "Could not migrate document to derivatives folder. Check file permissions."
- **Metadata Creation Failures**: "Document family metadata could not be created."
- **ID Conflicts**: "Document family ID already exists. Using alternative ID."

### Derivative Creation Errors

- **File Creation Failures**: "Could not create derivative document. Check folder permissions."
- **Content Copy Failures**: "Could not copy content from parent document."
- **Metadata Update Failures**: "Derivative created but metadata could not be updated."

## Integration Points

### With Iteration 1 Systems

- **Project Workspace**: Enhanced file browser showing family structure
- **File Extraction**: Extracted.det files now go to derivatives folder
- **Navigation**: Document family navigation integrated with workspace

### Future Integration Preparation

- **Advanced Derivatives**: Structure supports additional derivative types
- **Processing Chains**: Metadata structure expandable for complex chains
- **Search Integration**: Family structure ready for unified search indexing

## Success Criteria

### User Experience
