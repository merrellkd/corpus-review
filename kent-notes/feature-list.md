I am building a new iteration of pai-brains that focuses solely on a narrow use case of medicolegal analysis of a corpus of case files. This product is called Corpus Review. I will be using a spec driven developmen approach devised by github called Spec-Kit. This document is an attempt to isoloate the feature that will be fed, massaged and worked by this SDD approach.

12. DevOps Monitoring Module

User Value: "Monitor system health and track incidents with integrated documentation"

- Problem Solved: Disconnected monitoring and incident documentation
- Key Benefit: Real-time dashboards with document-based runbooks
- User Outcome: Faster incident resolution with complete documentation

13. Research & Academic Module

User Value: "Manage literature reviews with automated citation and reference tracking"

- Problem Solved: Manual citation management and research organization
- Key Benefit: Academic workflow optimization with citation automation
- User Outcome: Focus on research instead of reference management

Blueprint Configuration Features

14. Rapid Vertical Application Deployment

User Value: "Launch domain-specific applications in under 2 days with pre-configured templates"

- Problem Solved: Long development cycles for specialized tools
- Key Benefit: Core platform + modules + templates = instant vertical apps
- User Outcome: Time-to-market reduced from months to days

⏺ Each feature is now structured as a standalone value proposition with:

- Clear user value statement (the "why")
- Specific problem solved (the pain point)
- Key differentiating benefit (the "how")
- Measurable user outcome (the result)

This breakdown transforms the comprehensive spec into 14 distinct features that can be developed, marketed, and delivered independently while contributing to the
overall PAI-Brains platform vision.
